<p><b><a name="faq01">1. How do I view the phonetic information?</a></b></p>

<p>The phonetic data in the databases use a set of characters called the
International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). These characters are defined in a
character set called <a href="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode</a>. If you are
using a reasonably recent browser or operating system, you should be able to
view these with no problems.</p>

<p>To display IPA characters properly, however, you'll need to look at the <a
href="$$baseurl$$/utils/fonts.html">Fonts</a> page. It lists places you can go
to get Unicode fonts that contain IPA characters.</p>

<p><b><a name="faq02">2. I've installed a Unicode font, but those codes still
don't mean anything to me.</a></b></p>

<p>On the <a href="phonetics.html">Phonetics</a> page, there is a table showing
what sounds the various characters represent.</p>
