<p><b>Director:</b><br>
The late Harold B. Allen.</p>

<p><b>Areas covered:</b><br>
Minnesota, Iowa, North and South Dakota, and Nebraska with a few
informants from Manitoba, Ontario, and Saskatchewan.</p>

<p><b>Subjects:</b><br>
The 208 subjects are divided into the three types of Atlas
informants and include both males and females.</p>

<p><b>Nature of recordings:</b><br>
Interviews were collected between 1949 and 1962. About half of the
interviews are supplemented by approximately twenty minutes of
recordings on reel to reel tapes which have been rerecorded from
earlier wire recordings. The approximately 800 items of the Atlas
worksheets were recorded in phonetic transcription for the 208
informants. These transcriptions were made while the interview was
being conducted by the field workers. Moreover, there are 1064 mail
check-lists for 136 items on the list. For a detailed description
of the questionnaire and results see the <a href="#allen1973"><em>
Linguistic Atlas of the Upper Midwest</em></a>.</p>

<p><b>Archives:</b><br>
The Collection is now housed at the Newberry Library, 60 W. Walton,
Chicago, Illinois 60606. Contact the Newberry Library for further
