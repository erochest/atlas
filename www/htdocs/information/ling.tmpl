<p><b>Linguistics</b></p>

<p>Linguistics is a broad field that is even a bit hard to define. In general
linguists (people who study language) are not interested in whether a sentence
is "correct" or not (what you studied in grammar). Instead, they're more
interested in describing the way people actually use language. Sometimes they
focus on studying an abstract concept of language (what is English as someone
raised speaking English would recognize it); sometimes they focus on how it is
actually spoken (what did this woman say in response to this question, and how
did she say it).</p>

<p>The Linguistic Atlas Projects all study language in the second of those two
ways. Researchers have interviewed people and noted what they said and how
they said it. Did they say dragonfly or skeeter hawk? Did they say
<i>tomato</i> or <i>tomaato</i>?</p>

<p>As mentioned before, linguistics is a broad field that can reward a
lifetime of study. However, here are a few links to get you started:</p>
