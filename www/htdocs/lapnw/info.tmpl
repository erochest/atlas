The data was collected from 1953 to 1963. The interviewing
instrument followed the Linguistic Atlas of New England
questionnaire with some modifications made by David Reed and David
Decamp. The materials formerly included direct phonetic
transcription supplemented by soundscriber discs for fourteen
informants and reel to reel tapes for nineteen informants; in
addition, forty-nine records and nearly 300 postal check sheets
with vocabulary items were collected and tabulated. After Reed's
death, Carlson rescued some of the field records and has prepared
them for digital access.</p>

Project, University of Georgia, Department of English, University
