<p><b>Goals of LARMS and LAWS:</b><br>
LAMR goals include: an inventory of phonemes and a register of
regional and social markers. This research will be helpful in
determining what might be appropriate in the conduct of LAWS
research.</p>

<p><b>Areas covered in the LAWS grid:</b><br>
Sixty-five units for research in the Middle Rockies: Wyoming
(fifteen), Colorado (twenty-eight) and Utah (twenty-two). The
composition of the LARMS is a work in progress. It began in 1988
with the organization of the Wyoming grid. The map identifies
Wyoming counties in addition to providing a model for establishing
grid divisions, first for Colorado and Utah and then for Montana,
Idaho, West Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Oregon, and
Washington.</p>

<p><b>Nature of recordings:</b><br>
The Wyoming grid compositions illustrate the method of selection
and arrangement that were used in Colorado, where David Newton and
Madsen completed fieldwork in 1991, and Utah.</p>

<p><b>LARMS protocols:</b><br>
As with the LAGS project the protocol is the central research tool.
Still, unlike LAGS protocols the LARMS texts are complete records
of the interview, organized as prompts and responses, ordered as
numbered exchanges, and cued to worksheet references, with all
worksheet items entered in ABC notation.</p>
