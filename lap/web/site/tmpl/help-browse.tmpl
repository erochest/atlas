<p><b>Tips</b></p>

<ul>

<li>Don't use the "Back" for "Forward" buttons on your browser. They confuse
the site. Instead, use the controls provided on the web page.</li>

<li>When the map is shown, the selected communities (in red) are "hot". When
you click on one, a window pops up and displays detailed information about that
community, as well as lists all the informants in that community that are in
the current data set.</li>

</ul>
