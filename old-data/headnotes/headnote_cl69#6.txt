Pronunciations
==============
                                  "    1




M: White people who aren't well off, haven't had a chance at education, and the like, especially those that are good for nothing, too lazy to work, etc.  Does it make any difference if they're town or country people?
or
M: What do African-Americans call them?
or
M: Somebody who lives out in the country, doesn't know anything about town ways, and is conspicuous when he gets to town.  Of himself, he might say, "I don't know anything about city ways; I'm just an old _____."  How would town people refer to him?; e.g., children might say, "Look at that old _____."  [Ask about people from particular locations--mountains, swamps, sandhills, piney woods, redclay country, etc.] Any particular terms used by blacks?  Do you know the term "hoosier"? In what senses?
or
P: But you (or someone else or I) would be called a _____.  Any other words you might use in special situations?  If you were angry?  In a joking spirit?  Just an ordinary word you might use?  [With African-American informants, note generalization of terms for "poor whites" and "rustics", e.g., "redneck," "peckerwood," "cracker," and "hillbilly," for all Caucasians.] Could you call Richard Nixon a "peckerwood"? a "cracker"?

Notes from University of Georgia Atlas staff (1998-2000):

	Cohen:

As a general policy, responses which do not correspond to the target responses, those unrelated or irrelevant to the target, are considered inappropriate responses. Also, answers elicited in response to other questions (some on other pages), even if they correspond to the target, are considered inappropriate.  For example, McDavid (especially but not exclusively)often transcribed answers he elicited in response to other questions and in general conversation on the page and line which actually targeted the items.  Even though such items appear to be appropriate responses to the question asked on that page and line, they have been designated with (b) or (c) by the fieldworker to indicate that they are not actually responses to the target worksheet items and labeled inappropriate by the editorial staff.  Also, margin notes transcribed in phonetics, even if the items correspond to target items, are considered inappropriate responses to the question. 

For item 69#6, there are no inappropriate responses.

	Darwin:

		On Worksheets and Data for Gullah Speakers:

The preliminary worksheets used by Turner for interviews of Gullah speakers in South Carolina and Georgia (1933) differ somewhat from later versions used by Lowman, McDavid and Pedersen, both in enumeration and target response.  For example, page 4, question 2 from Turner's preliminary worksheets, "tomorrow," corresponds to page 4, question 1 of later versions; and page 14, question 1 from the preliminary worksheets, "I says/I said," has no corresponding question in later versions.  This incongruence was alleviated in the data files by the matching of target responses of the later worksheets to those of the preliminary versions when it was possible. In cases where there were no corresponding target responses, Gullah informant data were entered as NR (no response). 

Specifically for page 69 of the later version as listed in Handbook of the Linguistic Atlas of the Middle and South Atlantic States, the following correspondences are noted:
