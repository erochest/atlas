Notes on target items and data collection procedures:

	Kurath:
	
The salutation "good morning!" is used in meeting.  The stress is on the second word.

	R. Mc David:

The salutation "good morning" is used almost exclusively in greeting. The primary stress of the phrase is normally on the initial syllable of "morning".  McDavid occasionally recorded "morning" in conversation.  

Notes from University of Georgia Atlas staff (1998-2000): 
	
	Johnson:
	
This item was originally intended to record variant greetings, according to the worksheet question.  McDavid's recording of any conversational "morning" raises doubts about the status of the word alone as an elided form of the greeting "good morning".  Certainly, instances that were recorded preceded by an article or demonstrative are not greetings, and "the" is included in this file (although normally deleted elsewhere as per standard editorial practice) in order to disambiguate at least these occurences of "morning" as non-greetings.

There are numerous comments of ethnographic interest as to restrictions on the use of the greeting.  Also, several comments refer to the term "dinner" meaning "midday meal."  There are probably other instances of names for meals in the margins of the field records that were never added to a file.  If there was a comment "greeting only¢, this has been omitted, since this is the assumed unmarked use of "good morning."

	Cohen:

As a general policy, responses which do not correspond to the target responses, those unrelated or irrelevant to the target, are considered inappropriate responses. Also, answers elicited in response to other questions (some on other pages), even if they correspond to the target, are considered inappropriate.  For example, McDavid (especially but not exclusively)often transcribed answers he elicited in response to other questions and in general conversation on the page and line which actually targeted the items.  Even though such items appear to be appropriate responses to the question asked on that page and line, they have been designated with (b) or (c) by the fieldworker to indicate that they are not actually responses to the target worksheet items and labeled inappropriate by the editorial staff.  Also, margin notes transcribed in phonetics, even if the items correspond to target items, are considered inappropriate responses to the question. 

For item 2#3, "the morning" is inappropriate, as is marginalia. 

	Darwin:

		On Worksheets and Data for Gullah Speakers:

The preliminary worksheets used by Turner for interviews of Gullah speakers in South Carolina and Georgia (1933) differ somewhat from later versions used by Lowman, McDavid and Pedersen, both in enumeration and target response.  For example, page 4, question 2 from Turner's preliminary worksheets, "tomorrow," corresponds to page 4, question 1 of later versions; and page 14, question 1 from the preliminary worksheets, "I says/I said," has no corresponding question in later versions.  This incongruence was alleviated in the data files by the matching of target responses of the later worksheets to those of the preliminary versions when it was possible. In cases where there were no corresponding target responses, Gullah informant data were entered as NR (no response). 

Specifically for page 2 of the later version as listed in Handbook of the Linguistic Atlas of the Middle and South Atlantic States, the following correspondences are noted:
