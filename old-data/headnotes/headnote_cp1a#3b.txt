L:  If six men were to walk into the room and you looked up as they started to come in, you say "Which man?  Not the last man, but the _____.¢  The next man would be the _____.

Notes on target items and data collection procedures:

	R. McDavid:

McDavid often recorded "second" in conversation.  The final consonant may vary with the context.  

	Unattributed list manuscript note:

The worksheets suggest that "first," "second," "fifth," and "sixth" be obtained in the context "the ______ man,¢ but it cannot be assumed that all responses were recorded in this context.  Lowman, for example, asked, "If six men were to walk into the room and you looked up as they started to come in you say `Which man?  Not the last man, but the _____.'  The next man would be the _____...¢.  It is thus likely that many of his responses were in phrase-final position.  McDavid obtained many of his responses in conversation, and thus recorded them in a variety of contexts.  

Pronunciations of the vowel of "first" of the types [¸] or [¦] are found mainly among Type I speakers in the South Atlantic States, particularly in VA and NC.  Pronunciations with deletion of the final stop are found throughout the area, but are concentrated in SC and GA.

Notes from University of Georgia Atlas staff (1998-2000): 

	Johnson:

This item is on page 1 of the PSAS worksheets, but some informants have had the page cut in half and glued into a page 1A in the field records.

	Cohen:

As a general policy, responses which do not correspond to the target responses, those unrelated or irrelevant to the target, are considered inappropriate responses. Also, answers elicited in response to other questions (some on other pages), even if they correspond to the target, are considered inappropriate.  For example, McDavid (especially but not exclusively)often transcribed answers he elicited in response to other questions and in general conversation on the page and line which actually targeted the items.  Even though such items appear to be appropriate responses to the question asked on that page and line, they have been designated with (b) or (c) by the fieldworker to indicate that they are not actually responses to the target worksheet items and labeled inappropriate by the editorial staff.  Also, margin notes transcribed in phonetics, even if the items correspond to target items, are considered inappropriate responses to the question. 

For item 1A#3b, "fourth" and "third" are inappropriate, as is marginalia.

	Darwin:

		On Worksheets and Data for Gullah Speakers:

The preliminary worksheets used by Turner for interviews of Gullah speakers in South Carolina and Georgia (1933) differ somewhat from later versions used by Lowman, McDavid and Pedersen, both in enumeration and target response.  For example, page 4, question 2 from Turner's preliminary worksheets, "tomorrow," corresponds to page 4, question 1 of later versions; and page 14, question 1 from the preliminary worksheets, "I says/I said," has no corresponding question in later versions.  This incongruence was alleviated in the data files by the matching of target responses of the later worksheets to those of the preliminary versions when it was possible. In cases where there were no corresponding target responses, Gullah informant data were entered as NR (no response). 

Specifically for page 1A of the later version as listed in Handbook of the Linguistic Atlas of the Middle and South Atlantic States, the following correspondences are noted:
