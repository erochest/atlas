Notes on target items and data collection procedures:

	Kurath:
	
The map shows the participles and participial phrases recorded in the sentence "The weather (it) is clouding up," referring to a change from clear to cloudy.
	
Equivalent expressions recorded in the sentence "We are going to have  (some) falling weather¢ or the like, where the grammatical subject is "we" instead of "it" or "the weather", are represented in full.
	
In phrases consisting of participle plus adverb, the main stress is regularly on the latter.  Other phrases normally have the strongest stress on the last word.  

	R. McDavid:

"Cloud" was elicited by McDavid in South Carolina and Georgia and occasionally by other field workers.  The list includes singular and plural forms, as recorded, as well as synonyms or terms for particular kinds of clouds, especially those associated with a gathering storm.

Notes from University of Georgia Atlas staff (1998-2000):

	Johnson:
		
McDavid recorded numerous instances of [tl-] in "cloud(ing)".  Since Lowman consistently recorded present participles, this is a good file for comparing /±n/ with /-±î/.  

	Cohen:

As a general policy, responses which do not correspond to the target responses, those unrelated or irrelevant to the target, are considered inappropriate responses. Also, answers elicited in response to other questions (some on other pages), even if they correspond to the target, are considered inappropriate.  For example, McDavid (especially but not exclusively)often transcribed answers he elicited in response to other questions and in general conversation on the page and line which actually targeted the items.  Even though such items appear to be appropriate responses to the question asked on that page and line, they have been designated with (b) or (c) by the fieldworker to indicate that they are not actually responses to the target worksheet items and labeled inappropriate by the editorial staff.  Also, margin notes transcribed in phonetics, even if the items correspond to target items, are considered inappropriate responses to the question. 

For item 5#5, "order" is inappropriate, as is marginalia.

	Darwin:

		On Worksheets and Data for Gullah Speakers:

The preliminary worksheets used by Turner for interviews of Gullah speakers in South Carolina and Georgia (1933) differ somewhat from later versions used by Lowman, McDavid and Pedersen, both in enumeration and target response.  For example, page 4, question 2 from Turner's preliminary worksheets, "tomorrow," corresponds to page 4, question 1 of later versions; and page 14, question 1 from the preliminary worksheets, "I says/I said," has no corresponding question in later versions.  This incongruence was alleviated in the data files by the matching of target responses of the later worksheets to those of the preliminary versions when it was possible. In cases where there were no corresponding target responses, Gullah informant data were entered as NR (no response). 

Specifically for page 5 of the later version as listed in Handbook of the Linguistic Atlas of the Middle and South Atlantic States, the following correspondences are noted:
