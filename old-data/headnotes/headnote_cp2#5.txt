/in meeting?  in parting?/

L:  What can you say by way of greeting any time of day?  Do you say "Good day¢ when you meet them or when you leave them?

M:  If you left someone at 11 o'clock in the daytime, would you say anything?

Notes on target items and data collection procedures:

	Kurath:
	
	The salutation "good day!" is used mostly in parting.  The stress is on the second word.  Some informants use "good day!" only in meeting, others both in meeting and in parting.  Most of these informants are elderly, [unsophisticated --RIM] folk.
	 
Notes from University of Georgia Atlas staff (1998-2000): 

	Johnson:
	
As implied in the worksheet question, the field worker was to elicit "good day!" regardless of its usage.  Thus, it is considered an appropriate response in both its greeting and leave-taking senses.  The unmarked usage is in parting, and synonymous terms in this sense, e.g. "good-bye", are also found in this file.  The comment "only on parting¢ has not been included;  this can be assumed if not otherwise noted.

	Cohen:

As a general policy, responses which do not correspond to the target responses, those unrelated or irrelevant to the target, are considered inappropriate responses. Also, answers elicited in response to other questions (some on other pages), even if they correspond to the target, are considered inappropriate.  For example, McDavid (especially but not exclusively)often transcribed answers he elicited in response to other questions and in general conversation on the page and line which actually targeted the items.  Even though such items appear to be appropriate responses to the question asked on that page and line, they have been designated with (b) or (c) by the fieldworker to indicate that they are not actually responses to the target worksheet items and labeled inappropriate by the editorial staff.  Also, margin notes transcribed in phonetics, even if the items correspond to target items, are considered inappropriate responses to the question. 

For item 2#5, "what's good about it?" as an "answer to good day" is inappropriate, as is marginalia.

	Darwin:

		On Worksheets and Data for Gullah Speakers:

The preliminary worksheets used by Turner for interviews of Gullah speakers in South Carolina and Georgia (1933) differ somewhat from later versions used by Lowman, McDavid and Pedersen, both in enumeration and target response.  For example, page 4, question 2 from Turner's preliminary worksheets, "tomorrow," corresponds to page 4, question 1 of later versions; and page 14, question 1 from the preliminary worksheets, "I says/I said," has no corresponding question in later versions.  This incongruence was alleviated in the data files by the matching of target responses of the later worksheets to those of the preliminary versions when it was possible. In cases where there were no corresponding target responses, Gullah informant data were entered as NR (no response). 

Specifically for page 2 of the later version as listed in Handbook of the Linguistic Atlas of the Middle and South Atlantic States, the following correspondences are noted:
