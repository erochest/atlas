Pronunciations
==============
                                  "    3




M: [Almost inconceivable that some term wouldn't have appeared by this point in the interview.  Take off from such a term and explore.]  Terms whites use to them? about them?  Words you would probably use yourself?
P: Not too many years ago they had special facilities, from schools and public toilets to seats in restaurants and buses, for _____. {See M above] 

Notes on target items and data collection procedures:

	R. McDavid:

Not all items are derogatory for all informants.

	V. McDavid:

On Lowman's records, it is impossible to tell which is the neutral term and which contemptuous, if the latter is given at all.  Raven McDavid's records have a similar problem often.  This item and item 69#3 are often conflated.  What is neutral by the one who uses it is one question.  How it is regarded is another.

Notes from University of Georgia Atlas staff (1998-2000):

	Cohen:

As a general policy, responses which do not correspond to the target responses, those unrelated or irrelevant to the target, are considered inappropriate responses. Also, answers elicited in response to other questions (some on other pages), even if they correspond to the target, are considered inappropriate.  For example, McDavid (especially but not exclusively)often transcribed answers he elicited in response to other questions and in general conversation on the page and line which actually targeted the items.  Even though such items appear to be appropriate responses to the question asked on that page and line, they have been designated with (b) or (c) by the fieldworker to indicate that they are not actually responses to the target worksheet items and labeled inappropriate by the editorial staff.  Also, margin notes transcribed in phonetics, even if the items correspond to target items, are considered inappropriate responses to the question. 

For item 69#4, there are no inappropriate responses.

	Darwin:

		On Worksheets and Data for Gullah Speakers:

The preliminary worksheets used by Turner for interviews of Gullah speakers in South Carolina and Georgia (1933) differ somewhat from later versions used by Lowman, McDavid and Pedersen, both in enumeration and target response.  For example, page 4, question 2 from Turner's preliminary worksheets, "tomorrow," corresponds to page 4, question 1 of later versions; and page 14, question 1 from the preliminary worksheets, "I says/I said," has no corresponding question in later versions.  This incongruence was alleviated in the data files by the matching of target responses of the later worksheets to those of the preliminary versions when it was possible. In cases where there were no corresponding target responses, Gullah informant data were entered as NR (no response). 

Specifically for page 69 of the later version as listed in Handbook of the Linguistic Atlas of the Middle and South Atlantic States, the following correspondences are noted:
