	Two sets of terms are presented here, separated by semicolons: (1) words for the steel band on the rim of a wheel, and (2) words for the wooden rim to which the steel band is fastened and which it protects.
	The terms for the steel band are: "tire" (common), "rim", "band" (in eastern MD), "hoop" (in NJ and DE), and "tread" (34.2); the terms for the wooden rim are: "felly" (in NJ), "feller" (common, "fellow", #fellom (in coastal VA and NC), "rim", and "rimming".  "Felly" and its phonetic variants were frequently offered in the plural form.
	"Rim" is used by some as a synonym of "tire", by others as the equivalent of "felly", and some use it in both senses.  Others again say that the "rim" consists of the "fellies", of which there are said to be from 2 to 6 to one "rim"; or that the "rim" includes the "felly" and the "tire".
