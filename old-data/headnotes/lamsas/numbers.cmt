	The number items found on pages 1 and 1a of the worksheets have been consistently treated regarding application of the INA code.  In essence, INA has been applied to everything except the target number, that is, "seven" is ok, "seventh" and "seven feet" are not.  This is in keeping with the treatment accorded the responses in the list manuscript, with ordinal numbers usually shunted to the commentary and contextual forms also in the margins or commentary.
	The previous practice was to pull the pronunciation of the main item out of its context and include it in the main list alone.  We have changed this procedure and are including the whole phrase as a main item where it's all together in phonetics in the field record.  (That is, where we have noticed it or where it's listed marginally in the lms.  Who knows what contextual info might be found in the field records if we read from them all!  Such info was routinely omitted in preparing some lists, although it appears that, with the numbers, context was included in commentary where it occurred.)
