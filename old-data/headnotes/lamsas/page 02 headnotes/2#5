/in meeting?  in parting?/

L:  What can you say by way of greeting any time of day?  Do you say "Good day¢ when you meet them or when you leave them?

M:  If you left someone at 11 o'clock in the daytime, would you say anything?


	The salutation "good day!" is used mostly in parting.  The stress is on the second word.
	Some informants use "good day!" only in meeting, others both in meeting and in parting.  Most of these informants are elderly simple folk.

	Some informants use "good day!" only in meeting, others both in meeting and in parting.  Most of these informants are old and unsophisticated.
	[list of commentary]
	"Good morning!" and "good day!" should be separated:  2 lists.  [list ms 103 has both, separated by semi-colon]

	As implied in the worksheet question, the field worker was to elicit "good day!" regardless of its usage.  Thus, it is considered an appropriate response in both its greeting and leave-taking senses.  The unmarked usage is in parting, and synonymous terms in this sense, e.g. "good-bye", are also found in this file.  The comment "only on parting¢ has not been included;  this can be assumed if not otherwise noted.
	See table P2#3 for "good morning", and L2#4 and L2#6 for examples of "good afternoon, good evening," and "good night".  L2#6, "evening", has further instances of "goodbye" if collected as leave-takings after dark, as opposed to leave-takings used in the daytime, found here.
