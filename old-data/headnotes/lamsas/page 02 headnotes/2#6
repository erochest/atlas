/the part of the day after supper/ also includes 3.1:  /do you say good night in meeting?/

M (3.1):  What would you say when you're saying goodbye, when you're leaving someone's house at night?


	The map shows terms designating the time of day after supper. 	When both "evening" and "night" appear, these terms refer to the same time of day, though they may differ in social status, in currency, or in connotation.  Cases of "night" defined as late evening or as later than evening [are identified in the commentary].
	Precise delinitations of the periods denoted by the several terms were seldom recorded. 	The time after supper, depending largely on the informants' domestic habits, is defined as beginning at "5" o'clock (5.2, at "6" 92.1 , 2, 3.6, 6), at sunset 94.1, 2, 11.1, 112.1), or at dark (5.1, 7.1, 2, 3, 63.2).  The dividing line between "evening" and "night" is put variously at "8" o'clock 913.2, at "9" (25.2), at the coming of dark (14.2, 15.2, 25.3, 100.1), at bedtime (191.2).
	"Evening" `time after supper' is described as a modern term by 7.2, 25.1, 5, 31.1, 51.1, 52.2, 78.3, 94.2, 154.3, 177.2, 183.2, 198.3.
	"Night" `time after supper' is described as the usual term by 56.3, 109.2; and as old-fashioned by 61.2, 68.2.

File Name:  H003#1.D1

®TS5¯	"Goodnight!" as a greeting was included in original SAS-MAS work sheets.  GSL seem to have dropped it.  RIM sought both leave taking and greeting in the period after dark.  (This should be combined with similar "good" "afternoon"! - evening in a separate list)
	Goodnight®MDSU¯2" means clearly greeting.  [now identified in commentary].

-McDavid

[from lms 101] Note in lms in RIM's hand to check lms [102] for greetings.  (Suggestion to combine the lists follows.)  Also:  "because of verlaps, these items ["afternoon" and "evening"] should be published together.  A very long introduction and commentary should be provided.  [Al - this means you! - Raven]¢.


	"good afternoon" and "good evening" were elicited by McDavid and formed a short list subsidiary to this one, the contents of that list that were derived from question 2.6 were added to this file.
	To remedy the confusion/overlap between worksheet questions 2.4 and 2.6 ("afternoon" and "evening"), in parts of the list ms., the file was proofread from the field records, where the separation is fairly clear between responses to the two questions, especially since 2.5 ("good day") comes between them.  If a response at the end of the page specifically states that it applies to the time before supper, it was put into L2#4.  Likewise for something in the fourth position on the page that refers to the time after supper;  it was moved to this file (L2#6).  This decision was based on the stated referent of the worksheet question.
	"Good afternoon" and "good evening" were elicited by McDavid and formed a short list ms. subsidiary to this one.  The contents of that list that were derived from question 2.6 were added to this file, as well as the items from list ms 102, from question 3.1, "good night".  "Good night"" as (rarely) elicited by Lowman was meant as a greeting, hence it is comparable to McDavid's recordings of "good evening" for question 2.6.  The preponderance of responses to 3.1 were recorded by McDavid as leave-takings rather than greetings, and thus commentary identifying "good night" as used in parting only were omitted and any unmarked responses collected by Lowman marked as "greeting".  Other leave-taking phrases used at night are also included (e.g. "so long").
	The list ms. was not corrected during proofreading from the field records, so the computer files and lms have discrepancies between them.  In particular, entries for "evening" and "night" have been deleted if they were recorded in the context of greetings, hence appearing in the subsidiary list that has now been included together with the main list.  This avoids duplication.
	Other greetings may be found in files P2#3 ("good morning"), P2#5 ("good day", usually a leave-taking rather than a greeting), and L2#4 ("afternoon").  The "afternoon", "evening", and "good morning" files are of particular interest as complementary items for an analysis of distinctions between times of day.  There is a large amount of commentary in all these files noting times of day that use of the term is appropriate.
	Only marginal commentary transcribed in phonetics is considered inappropriate as a response to the question.  Appropriate responses include names for the time of day, alone as well as embedded in a greeting.
