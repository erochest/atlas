File Name: H029#5.D1

	"Swamp" was given by nearly all informants as the term for land covered with water all or part of the year.  
	"Swamp" is often described as overgrown with trees, thickets, or bushes.  For some informants "swamp" and "marsh" overlap in meaning.
	"Pocosin" and "bay" denote in common a swamp without an outlet.  "Bay", i.e., "Carolina bay", is a shallow, elliptical depression found throughout the coastal plain, but most commonly in the Carolina.  Some examples of "pond", mostly in South Carolina and Georgia, were indicated as equivalent in meaning to "swamp".
