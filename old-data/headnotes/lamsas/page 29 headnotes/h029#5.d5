	"Hammock(s)," "hammock land(s)," "high land," "hog hammock," "hummmock," "island(s)," "knoll(s)," "knoll place," and "tussock" all refer to land surrounded by swamp, march, or other low land, but distinguished by its vegetation or higher elevation.  Lowman recorded the terms in seeking the names for small elevations, e.g., "hill" and "knoll" in the preliminary survey of the South Atlantic States; McDavid recorded them as part of the description of "swamp."
