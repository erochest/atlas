	The word is new to some informants (176, 190.1, 191.1, 197.1, 199.1) and unfamiliar to others.  Note also several cases of "milk" "dairy" (66, 156.1).
	Close contact between the stressed vowel and the following "r"- sound in pronunciations of the types of [de´±¿] is indicated in the VA records by hyphen after the "r" (e.g. 100.1 d²´±¿‹).  Elsewhere this device was not used by the field worker.
