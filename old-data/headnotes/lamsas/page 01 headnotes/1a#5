M:  Sometimes you feel you get your good luck just a little at a time, but you bad luck comes _____.


	The list contains the expression "all at once" or "all to once" in response to the statement "your bad luck come _____¢.  In addition, for NY, SC, GA and FL, the list included a variety of responses other than "all at once".
	The pronunciation [-st] is used mainly by type I informants.

-unknown author


	In the phrase "all at once" ("all to once"), `suddenly', `all of a sudden', the main stress is regularly on the last word.

-Kurath


	"Once" was usually recorded, especially by GSL, in the context "all at once".  RIM and others also recorded "once" in other contexts.
	Occasional lexical variants of "all at once" `suddenly' were recorded, such as "all of a sudden, in one wham".  These phrases are entered in the commentary.  [They are now in the main list, not marked INA - EJ]

-McDavid


	Only "all of it" and "all the way", along with commentaries "when it rains, it pours" and "double trouble" were marked as INA.  Anything that had "once" in it was considered appropriate for McDavid to record in the field record.  Synonymous phrases for "all at once" are appropriate answers to the most common elicitation cue.
		This item is on page 1 of the PSAS worksheets, but some informants have had the page cut in half and glued into a page 1A in the field records.
	See also P1#1A, "one".  There is a map of the [-st] variants with the list manuscript, as well as an accompanying chart by informant type.
