	"Thousand" was systematically investigated only by Lowman in the SAS, SA and MAS, by McDavid in NY, and in the later taped interviews.

-lms note

	The word "thousand", not included in the original South Atlantic worksheets, was recorded only in later stages of Lowman's field work.  McDavid did not investigate the item in South Carolina and Georgia.

For this item, 2 problems (GSL records):  
	1)  For initial member of /a¹/, ½ and Ý may be confused.  If in doubt, probably the former.
	2)  Cursive writing of diphthong may make [a] and [°] confused.  Almost always the former.  Note his cursive [°], [drawing], is usually [a].

-McDavid


"Thousand" was not elicited in the PSAS nor was it elicited by RIM in SC and GA, except for SC11E, 26A, and 42E.  Those elicited are all from the tapes or from Lowman.  Should a note to this effect precede this list?

INA:  plural, Dutch, "million".

There is a problem with this file in regard to NA vs. NR (see above).  Probably all of SAS except taped interviews and 3 SC infs. noted above should be marked NA, but this change hasn't been made.
