	The word usually has four syllables.  Clearly trisyllabic forms are rare; NJ5A, VA59N, NC25N.  Forms ending in [-w´±¿] have four syllables, i.e. the [´] is syllable.
	Forms ending in -w²r±¿, -we®MDSU¯±¿r"±¿, -w²´±¿, -wá´±¿, -²´±¿ have a secondary stress on the third syllable.  Forms terminating in -w°r±¿, -w´±¿ have no marked secondary stress.  In some instances (VA40B, VA71B, VA75A, NC61A, etc.) the final syllable is slightly heavier than the third.
	Pronunciations of the type of [dú±n-] are still current but often regarded as old-fashioned.
