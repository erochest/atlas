ÆTS5Ø
	The map presents only forms used in the plural sense.  The word always refers to the posts of a fence (a barbed wire fence, a picket fence or certain types of rail fences).
	The inflected plural has the following types of pronunciation: Pousts, pouss, pouês, poust±øz, pous±øz.  The uninflected plural type ends in [t.
	Pronunciations of the type of  [pous], terminating in a short [s], are rare: N53, 56.2, 68.1, 79.1, 86, 91.2, 98.2, 99.1, N150, N179.  They probably represent the uninflected plural type with loss of final [t].
	Several informants use "stobs" besides "posts" (67.1, N69, 99.1, N165, 178.1)
