Commentary or cross-reference to "riz bread" (44.3, 44.4) and "riz doughnuts" (45.2).  [Also] "raised/rear" from the PSAS worksheets (65).

-McDavid


	As noted above, this file presumably contains only the preterite of the verb "rise", unless otherwise noted.  There is commentary that identifies a few forms as infinitives or participles.  These parts of the verb have been marked as inappropriate.  Preterites of other verbs, synonymous with "rose" in the context of sunrise (chiefly "came up") are not marked INA.
