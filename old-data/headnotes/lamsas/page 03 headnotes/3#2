Note:  (Here as elsewhere) Lowman's cursive phonetics SOMETIMES make it difficult to distinguish between [±¿] and [²] as the second member of the diphthong /ai/.  (I'm sure I misread some - RIM) check carefully!  To be broken up into two tables.

	Several items are included in this file which are likely appropriate answers to the question (phrased as the time work began in the morning), but which are not synonymous with "sunrise".  These include "daylight", "first light, day, before light", etc., and are not considered INA, as are phrases encompassing the whole day:  "from sun to sun, can-see to can't", etc.  It is complementary to L3#4, "sunset".
