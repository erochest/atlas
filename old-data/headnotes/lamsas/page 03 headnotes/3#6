He came)   /record equivalents/

M:  If somebody came on Sunday, the last Sunday, if he came a week earlier than last Sunday, you'd say he came here _____.


	This expression and its equivalents was recorded in the context "He" "came" "Sunday" "before" "last".  The following expression are current:
	
	"Sunday" "week", "Sunday" "a" "week", "Sunday" ("a") "week" "ago";
	"last" "Sunday" ("a") "week", û "the" "week" (21.1);
	"last" "Sunday" "was" "a" "week" ("ago"): 19.1, 173.1, 185.2, 188.1, 195.1, 199.2, 		202.1;
	"Sunday" "before" "last";
	"Sunday" "afore" "last": N53, N69, N91, 99.1, 106, 154.1, N163;
	"last" "week" "Sunday" (25.5).

	On the maps the word "Sunday" has been replaced by (û).  The word will be found on the next map.
	All expression ending in "week" have the main stress on that word.
	Note that "Sunday" ("a") "week" is used also in sentences referring to the future.  See the next list. [L3#7]

-Kurath


	The referent of the expressions in this file is unclear for McDavid's fieldwork.  It may be assumed that Lowman only recorded phrases for the Sunday a week before the previous Sunday, but the proliferation of responses recorded by RIM, including "last Sunday", "two weeks ago Sunday, June was a year ago", et al, indicate that he recorded any phrase referring to past time without noting its specific referent in most cases.  Thus many responses other than the target response are left as appropriate, with INA reserved only for rare marginal commentary.
	Kurath in his headnote used the spelling "afore".  I have further distinguished variants of `before' by using the spelling "fore" (found in DARE).
	For comparison, see L3#7, "Sunday after next", which contains further instances of "Sunday week".  Other files for days of the week are P2#1A, P2#1B, P2#2A, P2#2B ("Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday", and "Saturday").
