Is he coming)   /record equivalents/
M:  He's going to leave next Sunday;  a week beyond Sunday would be what?


	The field worker recorded this expression and its equivalents in contexts like "He is coming Sunday a week".
	The following expressions are in use:"  Sunday (a) week", with stress on "week";  "next Sunday (a) week", "coming Sunday a week" with stress on "week";  "a week from Sunday", with stress on "Sunday";  "Sunday after next", with stress on "after" or "next";  "the following Sunday;  Sunday coming next".
	Note that many informants use the phrase "Sunday (a) week" also in contexts like "He was here Sunday a week".  See the preceding item [L3#6].
	This item was not investigated in New England or the North Central States.
	McDavid sometimes recorded another day of the week than Sunday.

Notes in list ms.

	Al--- How should stress be handled?  Supply canonical forms in headnote and mark the others in the list?  The stress has been added, e.g. Bloch list mss. until a convention is established to remove it ---RKO
	5 minutes later:  But there are probably MORE forms with no indication of stress or some abridged indication of stress than there are "canonical¢ forms.

Lowman's [¶”] is edited on Bloch-Kurath list mss a [Þ].

Al:  For this, and some other items, there are some sizeable gaps.  We'll need to think on our way of handling these.  -RIM [re ?]


	The referent of the expressions in this file is unclear for McDavid's fieldwork.  It may be assumed that Lowman only recorded phrases for the Sunday a week after the next Sunday, but the proliferation of responses recorded by RIM, including "next Sunday", "Wednesday two weeks", et al, indicate that he recorded any phrase referring to future time without noting its specific referent in most cases (although some comments like "= next Sunday", "not the same as `Sunday week'¢ are an attempt to clarify).  Thus many responses other than the target response are left as appropriate, with INA reserved only for rare marginal commentary.
	For comparison, see L3#6, "Sunday before last", which contains further instances of "Sunday week".  Other files for days of the week are P2#1A, P2#1B, P2#2A, P2#2B ("Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday", and "Saturday").
