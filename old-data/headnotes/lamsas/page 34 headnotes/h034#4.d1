	The map presents (a) "horseshoes", the name of the metal shocs of a horse, and (b) the terms for the well-known game in which horseshoes or rings are pitched to a stake, or solid metal disks or rocks into a hole.
	The two items are separated by a semicolon.  However, if "horseshoes" is used both in senses (a) and (b), it is followed by a superior {2} instead of being repeated after the semicolon.
	Informants N140 and 154.2 use "shods" of the shoes of a horse.
