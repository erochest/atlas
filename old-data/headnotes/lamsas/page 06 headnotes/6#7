L:  If the rain is just coming down in fine little driblets, instead of stopping, you say the rain is still ____ on.
M:  If it's not as much as a shower, just barely laid the dust, what would you call that?  The kind of rain that might have been coming down and you could walk a mile in and hardly get wet, what would you call that?

	The map shows the phrase "steady" "drizzle", denoting a continuous fall of rain, mistlike rain.  The main stress is on the noun.
	The present participle of the verb "drizzle" and of related verbs ("It's" "drizzling", "The" "rain" "is" "drizzling") was systematically recorded in the early stages of the field work.  All cases are given in the commentary [now included in main file].

-Kurath


	In addition to a heavy (often violent and destructive) rain of short duration (6.1), some field workers, especially McDavid, sought designations for (a) a short, moderate rain (characteristically "shower"), and (b) one short and very light (characteristically "sprinkle").
	Where "shower" is given as the first or only response for 6.1, it is entered in that list manuscript and a  entered here.  [all instances of "shower" recorded with question one are restored to L6#1 in the computer file, though "sprinkle" and "drizzle" found anywhere on the page are here in L6#7. -EJ]
	Examples of "thunder" "shower" are included in the data for "thunderstorm".

-McDavid


	Lowman treated this as a pronunciation item, consistently recording the pronunciation "steady drizzle" and rarely recording lexical variants.  McDavid, as implied above, collected lexical entries for any type of rain lighter than a downpour and without thunder and lightning.  Verbs and adjectives used to describe this weather are also included here as appropriate responses.
	Related files are L6#1, "heavy rain", and L6#2, "thunderstorm".  "Dew" is entered with "frost" in L7#4.  There are enough instances of "steady" in this file to compare the pronunciation with [²] vs. [¸].
