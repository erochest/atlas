	The map shows terms for an electrical storm, usually but not always accompanied by rain, with or without a high wind.  Among the most common terms are the compounds "thunder" "storm", û "gust", û "shower", û "squall", and û "cloud", and the simplex "gust".  Cf. [L6#1].
	All the compounds have initial stress, with a strong secondary stress on the second member
	[list of commentary follows]
	The simplex "squall" was offered as a near-synonym of both "heavy rain" and "thunderstorm", variously defined or without definition.  All instances are given in the following list.  (The compound "thunder squall" is entered on the map.)  [list follows]

	As noted above, "squall" is a problem here.  The file for "heavy rain", L6#1 overlaps with this one, semantically and on the field record page.  Names for storms where wind is the dominant feature (rather than rain or lightning) could logically go with either, but they have routinely been included here.  "Squall" is usually in this category, though we have tried to keep in L6#1 the instances of it that were recorded as though synonymous with "heavy rain".  Since so many names for storms involving mostly wind, but possibly also thunder and lightning, are recorded here, they are not considered inappropriate.
	This is not so for words like "hurricane, tornado, blizzard" and other miscellaneous storms that really go with neither file and are usually found in the margins.  "Hurricane", "tornado" and its synonyms, and storms involving sand, dust, or snow, are all marked as inappropriate.  "Hail storm" usually is listed in the main body of the field record and is not marked INA.  Other inappropriate responses include, as usual, commentary noted in phonetics.
	Other than L6#1, related files are L6#7, "shower", and L5#5, "clouding up".  The words "thunder" and "storm" probably occur often enough to be analyzed phonetically.
