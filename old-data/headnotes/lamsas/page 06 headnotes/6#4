	The map shows the expressions recorded in the sentence ""The" "wind" "is" "from" "the" "south"¢: "from" "the" "south", "to" "the" "south", "to" "the" "southard", "out" "south", "about" "south", etc.
	All these phrases have the main stress on the last word.  The phrase "from" "the" "south" occasionally has a secondary stress on the preposition (thus 83.2, 88.2, 95, 118.1).
	In six cases (135.1, 2, 138.1, 140.1, 146.2, 3) it is not clear from the field worker's record whether the word "south" is part of a phrase ("to" "the" "south") or used alone ("The" "wind" "is" "south".)  [These were recorded in the field record aligned with "southward" in the phrase "to the southward" but without ditto marks.  EJ]

	The major aims of this question seem to be two:  to record how people express wind direction (varying prepositional and adverbial constructions) and to get the pronunciation of "south".  McDavid focussed on the first and often recorded responses about winds from any point on the compass.  To compensate for the lack of a "south" pronunciation recorded in this context, he then recorded that word in isolation from conversation in presumably other contexts.
	The contents of this file reflect this philosophy of recording items for this question.  Any phrase including a pronunciation of "south" is considered an appropriate answer, as well as anything denoting wind direction.
	This file is closely to related to P6#5A and B and P6#6A and B, "southwest wind, southeast wind, northwest", and "northeast".  Responses involving winds from these directions are included there instead of with this file.
	Completed files with the same vowel (in addition to the "south-" compounds noted above) include:  "clouding up" (L5#5), "drought" (L7#1), "going down" (L7#3), and "mountain" (P31#1).
	A common pronunciation for the word we have spelled as "southward", though Kurath (see above) spelled as "southard", is /s¸ä´d/.  These cannot be distinguished from the orthography.
