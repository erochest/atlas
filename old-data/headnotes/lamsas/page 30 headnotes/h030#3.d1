	"Creek" was most often given by informants to refer to a stream next to size after "river".  In NY the term used is "brook" (List 47).  Sometimes, however, "creek" is considered indistinguishable in size from "branch".  In coastal areas "creek" refers to a small tidal inlet from the sea, not a running stream.  This meaning was elicited in WS 30.3 and those responses are marked ®MDSU¯2".  It should be noted, however, that most informants along the coast use the term in this manner and many of the responses not marked ®MDSU¯2" are tidal inlets.  This can be verified by examining creek place names from these areas on a map.  A number of informants describe a "creek" as salt and others as tidal (Use List).  Other terms for inlet are in List 46a ("Inlet").  "Creek" also sometimes refers to a small runoff or inlet from a river.
	In the swamp lands of the low country "creek" is sometimes used in place names indifferently in meaning with "branch" and "swamp".  See "swamp®MDSU¯2" (List 36) and "branch®MDSU¯2" (List 47).
