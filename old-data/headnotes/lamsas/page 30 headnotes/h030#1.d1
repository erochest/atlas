	The present participle of the verb "drain" was elicited by Lowman in the context "If you are getting water off a piece of land, you are ___________ it."  Lowman obtained the participle in nearly every case, recording only twenty-three examples of the uninflected form.  In one case (VA 58*), he commented that the form [driºn] was a participle.
	McDavid, on the other hand, south responses to item 30.1 by asking the question "If you want water off a piece of land, what do you do?"  As a result, he recorded nearly three times as many examples of the uninflected form as the participle.  He also recorded a variety of other verbs beside "drain".  All verbs other than forms of "drain" have been entered on List 38a ("Ditch it").
	Pronunciations of the type [driºn ] occur mainly among type IA informants.  Pronunciations of this type were reported by a number of informants to be old-fashioned or heard from the older generation.
