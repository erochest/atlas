	The map presents the terms for china ware: "china", "china" "ware" (28, 83.1, ®MDSU¯*"90.1, 188.1, 199.1, 202.1), "porcelain" (34.2).
	A number of instances of "delft" in the sense of `earthen ware', incidentally recorded, have been entered on the map )124, 125, 126, 191.1, 195.1, 198.2, 200.1, 201.1, 202.1, 2).
	Pronunciations of the type of [tóe±¿n±¿] are natural; to some of the older informants.  Others say [tóa±¿°] or [tóa±¿n±¿]. but [tóe±¿n±¿ tòi½i] (see the commentary).
