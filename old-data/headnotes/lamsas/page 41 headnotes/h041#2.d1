	In a number of instances the singular form was recorded instead of the plural.  The word is nearly always disyllabic.  The following types of pronunciation are thus to be read in to syllables: 3.1 f¥¥z, 13.1 fr¥∫¥z, 4,1 f¥∫∞z, 180.1 f≥∫∞éz, 9.3 f¥∫o{u}z, 116.2 f≥∫±øz, 103.1 f∞¥-¥, 136.2 f≥¥-¥z, N165 f≥ ∞€z.
	Pronunciation in one syllable is rare: 67.2, f¿¥, 71.2 f¿é∫z, 109.1 f¥∫z, 124 f¥z, 125, 126 f≥¥z, 154.2 f¥∫z.
	The second syllable is sometimes very brief, as in 15.2 f¥¥›z, 18.1 f¥∫¥›, 30.1 f¥∫∞›z, 64.1 f¿∫{r∞}z, 91.1 f≥ {r∞}, 170.1 f¿∫{∞}∞›z.
