®TS5¯	The map shows the terms for the upper part of the barn, the floor or scaffold above the barn floor:  "loft", "hay" "loft", "barn" "loft", "stable" "loft", "up-loft" (62.2, N69, N140, N150); "mow", "hat" "mow"; "overhead" (136.2); "overden" (40.2, 103.1), of Pennsylvania German origin, cf. Ger. "Obertene"; "hay" "room" (66).
	Some apply "loft" only to the upper part of a small barn 922.2, 29.2), of a "shed" "barn" (22.2, 42) or a "stable" (16.3, 27.2, 93.1), "mow" being the term for the upper floor of a large barn.
	"Mow" usually denotes a loft, but some apply it to the sections for hay on either side of the barn floor (especially in a "bank" "barn": 8.2, 23, 27.2, 42, etc.).  This meaning of ("hay") "mow" is identified on the map by a superior figure 2.
