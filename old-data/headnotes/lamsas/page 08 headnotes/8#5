No lms note

	This file includes terms for several types of wood pieces:  the large "backlog" (unsplit and burned in a fireplace), smaller "chunks" or "sticks" (split wood for stove), and "chunks" in the sense of end pieces left when the center of a piece of wood burns but not the ends.  These are indistinguishable except for some commentary that offers definitions.  The question for the PSAS had two parts:  a) pronunciation of "log" and b) split wood for stove.  Both are entered into the list manuscript without the (b) identifying mark for the second part which Lowman uses in the field records.
	Since the list manuscript includes all these types in the main list rather than the margins, they are all considered appropriate responses in the computer file, although they have different referents.  Also considered appropriate is any phrase containing the morpheme "log".  The only inappropriate items are commentary, especially noting types of wood (e.g. "oak").
	"Lightwood" and "kindling", etc. are not included here, but belong with the following question in file L8#6.  A number of other fireplace-related items are on page 8.  Also of interest for comparison is "dog", P33#1, "hogs", P35#5. and instances of "bog" in the file for `swamp', L29#5.
