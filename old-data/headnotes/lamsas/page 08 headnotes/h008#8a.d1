®FC¯Burns Coal in the Stove

®FL¯®TS5¯®FL¯
	In the inland area of Yankee settlement less often in the South, "into" may be used as a preposition of location, as "they burn coal into the stove:.  This usage was systematically investigated only in the preliminary SAS records and in upstate New York; though Lowman elsewhere occasionally noted conversational occurrences.  McDavid also recorded occurrences of "in".
