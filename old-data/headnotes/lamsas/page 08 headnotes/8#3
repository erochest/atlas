	The following terms are in use:

	"andirons", widespread, especially among the younger informants;
	"handirons", on Chesapeake Bay and northward;
	"andy-irons" (39, 62.2, 94.2, +107.1, 158.1);
	"end-irons" (60.1, 67.2, 71.2);
	"dog irons", widespread;
	"fire irons", scattered;
	"log irons" (8.1, 69.1, 2);
	"pig irons" (N63, N69);
	"anvil irons" (158.1);
	"fire dogs", widespread;
	"wood dogs" (23.1, 93.2);
	"dogs" 912.2, 24.1, 40.1, 101.1, 120.1, 170.1, 186);
	"fire anvils" (176);
	"fire horse" (5.1);

	Several informants use the simplex "dogs" (12.2, 24.1, 40.1, 101.1, 120.2, 170.1, 186) and one the simplex "irons" (7.2).  Note also the isolated "fire logs" (25.1).
	Formerly rocks and clay hobbs were used in simple houses instead of irons:

	"fire rocks" (185.1, 189.1, 190.1, 193.1, 200.1, 2, 201.1);
	"corner rocks" (197.1);
	"dog hobbs" (141.1);
	"fire hobbs" (67.1).

	All compound terms are stressed on the first element.  
	Consult the commentary below for individual definitions.
-Kurath


	Not all terms refer to the same object, as noted above in the discussion of "fire rocks", etc. (also cf. "grate").  Anything used to lay logs on in a fireplace is considered an appropriate response, although a few items used for burning coal are marked INA, as are things like "fender" and "screen".  Sometimes "andirons" or "dog irons" are used with a different meaning, e.g. implement for ironing clothes, and these uses are considered inappropriate.
	Two responses have dubious spellings:  "anvil irons" (pron. without a /v/) and "cold irons" (first syllable homonymous with "called¢).  The pronunciation with epenthetic /i/ (Kurath's "andyirons¢) is not distinguished in spelling, although the one with initial /h/ is, per LAGS practice.
	This question was often not included in the preliminary SAS interviews.  Some informants offer comments on the style, material, or size of referents.
