	The vowel is the focus of interest for this item.  Cf. the same Middle English vowel in "marsh", P29#6.  Relic forms with [á] are found especially in NC and VA, those with [³] in the Middle Atlantic States, GA and SC.
	"Fireplace" was regularly elicited by McDavid in conjunction with "hearth" and "chimney" (P8#1).  It may appear in either first, second, or third position on the field records.  It was not included in either list manuscript.  We have included it here with "hearth", and have not marked it inappropriate, since it could conceivably be a response to a question intended to elicit "hearth" and it is listed in the main body of the field record rather than in the margin.  More likely it should be considered a supplemental worksheet item added by McDavid as a way to record the vowel of "fire".  Thus, it should probably not be treated as a lexical variant, as "fire hearth, firerock," or "chimney hearth" might be.
