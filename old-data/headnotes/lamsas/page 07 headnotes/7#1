/long or short duration?/
L:  When it goes without raining for weeks at a time, you say you are having a ____.
M:  If you've gone a couple of weeks without rain, you'd call that a what?  Now you get a dry spell and it lasts about six weeks, long enough to hurt the crops;  what would you call that?


	The map shows terms for a period of dry weather: "drought", "drouth", "dry" "spell", û "time", û "weather", etc.  A "drought" or "drouth" is sometimes said to last longer or to be more severe than a "dry" "spell"; thus 36.3, 52.1, 54.1, 61.2, 67.2, 80, 95, 108, 110.1, 114.1, 118.1, 120.2, 121.1, 122.2, 166.2.
	Expression consisting of "dry" plus a noun appear with the main stress on either the first or the second word.  All marks of primary stress written by the field workers are retained in the entries.  (The unmarked word in such an expression always has a strong secondary stress.)
	The term "dry"(at 15.1, 127, 128.2, 152.1) was recorded without comment.  It may be only the first word of an expression like "dry" "spell", with the second word accidentally omitted from the record.  [list of commentary]

LMS notes:
	If "dry spell" and "drought" are kept in the same list, keep in consistent order.  Possible to divide into 124 and 124a plus misc. commentary:  124 = "dry spell", etc., 124a = "drought".  [not separated]  -RIM
	Note:  the cursive script of Lowman with his looping to cross a final -t often makes it look like a -ù.  I'm sure I erred, often.  Please check all the NY-OH records!  (Carbons ok for this.)  [Field records checked 8/15/90.]  -RIM
	There are a no. of e.g.s of "wet spell" on p.6, esp. 6.2.  Clear 6.2 of e.g.s of "wet spell".  [sep. lms page entered in this file apparently contains these:  L6#2 has no instances of "wet spell".]
	Make a decision about whether to put VA34A commentary, "a long season in May¢ (= wet cold weather), from list 59 "long ways" into this or some other related list manuscript.  Take note!  p. 40.1.  [not in this file].


	As noted above, a page of "wet spell" responses was entered in this file.  These are marked as inappropriate, as are "rainy spell" and other "spell" phrases noted for comparison and miscellaneous commentary.  "Wet drouth" is not marked INA, since it includes a pronunciation of "drouth", though it could be an antonym (no indication in f.r.).
