	The map shows expressions recorded in the sentence ""The" "wind" "is" "subsiding"¢, or in a similar context, referring to a decrease in the strength of the wind: "subsiding", "laying", "lying", "moderating", û "down", û "out", "calming", û "down", û "off", "calming in, lulling, lulling down, quieting, quieting down, quieting off," "dying", û "down", û "out", û "away", "bating", "lightening", "going" "down", "getting" "calm(er)", "letting" "up", etc.
	Expressions consisting of participle plus adjective or adverb regularly have the main stress on the second word.  [list of commentary follows]

	There are only a few inappropriate responses in this file.  Most refer to a decrease in rain rather than wind.  McDavid often recorded responses that are not present participles, but these are not considered inappropriate if they are semantically related to the question.  The file contains numerous instances of "a-" prefixing with present participles, and variation between "laying" and "lying" (among other variants).  Antonyms may be found in L7#2, (wind is) "rising".
