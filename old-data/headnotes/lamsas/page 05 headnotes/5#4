	The map shows the participles and participial phrases recorded in the sentence ""The" "weather" (or "I""t") "is" "clearing" "up"¢, referring to a change from cloudy to clear: "clearing", û "up", û" off", û away, û "fairing", û up, û "off", û "breaking", û "away", û "up", û "off", "settling" "off", etc.
	In phrases consisting of participle plus adverb, the main stress in regularly on the latter.  [list of commentary]

	Preceding context, when "it's" or "weather's", has been routinely omitted from the responses.  The exception is if it includes an unusual pronunciation or forms an interesting construction.  Very few responses are marked INA:  only marginalia.
	In areas where McDavid was the principle field worker, one may compare the intervocalic /r/ to one at the end of, especially, "clear" and "fair" (often followed by a word beginning with a vowel), bearing in mind that RIM's pre-1964 SAS records combine /´/ and /r/ intervocalically as /r/, though not across word boundaries.  RIM also recorded numerous instances of [tl-] in "clearing".  Since Lowman consistently recorded present participles, this is a good file for comparing /±n/ with /-±î/.  See L5#5, "clouding up", for antonyms and further instances of "-ing".
	For an analysis of the lexical variation in the file, see the article by Edgar Schneider and William Kretzschmar in Kretzschmar, Schneider, and Johnson 1989 ("Journal of English Linguistics" 22.1).
