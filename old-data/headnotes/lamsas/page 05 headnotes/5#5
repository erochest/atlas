	The map shows the participles and participial phrases recorded in the sentence ""The" "weather" ("It") "is" "clouding" "up"¢, referring to a change from clear to cloudy: "Clouding", û "up", "brewing", û "up", "thickening" "up", "changing", "threatening", "getting" "cloudy", "getting" "ready" "for" "rain", û" for" "a" "storm", û "for" "falling" "weather", "fixing" "for" "rain", "going" "to" "storm", "going" "to" "be" ("some") "falling" "weather", and many others.
	Equivalent expressions recorded in the sentence ""We" "are" "going" "to" "have" ("some") "falling" "weather"¢ or the like, where the grammatical subject is "we" instead of "it" or "the" "weather", are represented in full.
	In phrases consisting of participle plus adverb, the main stress is regularly on the latter.  Other phrases normally have the strongest stress on the last word.  [list of commentary]

	"Cloud" was elicited by McDavid (in SC and GA), occasionally by other field workers.  The list includes singular and plural forms, as recorded, as well as synonyms or terms for particular kinds of clouds, especially those associated with a gathering storm.

	Preceding context, when "it's" or "weather's", has been routinely omitted from the responses, as implied above.  The exception is if it includes an unusual pronunciation or forms an interesting construction.
	This file is a composite of several list manuscripts (113, 113a, b, c, d) and worksheet questions.  In addition to the responses collected for question 5.5, PSAS responses to the question for "gloomy day" are included as appropriate answers, since synonyms were often recorded by RIM for 5.5.  Two files were appended as inappropriate responses:  "clouds", collected by McDavid only; and "hazy", a question on the preliminary SAS worksheet.
	RIM recorded numerous instances of [tl-] in "cloud(ing)".  Since Lowman consistently recorded present participles, this is a good file for comparing /±n/ with /-±î/.  See L5#4, "clearing up", for antonyms and further instances of "-ing".  P14#1, "house", and P31#1, "mountain", provide more pronunciations of the diphthong /a¹/.
