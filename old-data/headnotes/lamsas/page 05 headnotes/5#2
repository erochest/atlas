	The indefinite article [°], which always precedes this phrase, is omitted from the entries on the map.
	The mark of primary stress is included in the entries whenever the field worker wrote it.  In phrases of the type "a" "year" "aågo", the word "year" always has a strong secondary stress.  [list of commentary]

On the occurrence of ´°, r° in year ago.

Lowman:
  Frequently in both MAS and SAS has the sequence ´  ° with a space between words.
  Sometimes has r  ° with a space, sometimes rŸ°.  In the list manuscript section done by McDavid, the ligature was preserved.  Kurath left out the ligature and left a space between words.  Perhaps K thought the ligature was not so much a symbol of the loss of the word boundary as it was a way to note that the r only occurred here because of the following vowel environment.  This latter meaning can be checked now in the computer files by comparing this file to others with postvocalic r.
  We have followed Kurath's practice and left spaces between the words.  This conforms to handbook guidelines for word spacing.  (We use ligature only to denote co-articulation, so to represent this type of tie between words, we must delete the spacing between them.)  This decision was based on the ease of adding a space (in basically about half of the Lowman NY records and a few others) vs. checking the field records for presence or absence of ligature in the rest of the LAMSAS territory.  It provides for consistency, while possibly sacrificing some accuracy.

McDavid:
  NEW YORK.  In almost all his NY records and in the list ms. for NY McDavid has the sequence ´  °.
  SOUTH CAROLINA.  Someone at U. of SC took it upon themselves to erase portions of the field records and `correct' them according to the editorial conventions for producing list mss.  The guide reads, "In all SAS records made before 1964:  intervocalic -´-, whether on-line or superior, should be replaced by -r-."  The field records have been changed, and McDavid uses r instead of ´ in his list ms. up to about the middle of the state.  (Note:  In other files, this change has not been made ACROSS word boundaries, only, as stipulated, intervocalically).  At SC31B, scattered instances of   ´ ° begin to appear in the list ms, although they have all been changed to r ° in the field records.  The list ms alternations seem to have no relation to date of the interview.
  GEORGIA.  Like SC, GA has both variants, with r prevailing although our (xeroxed carbon) copies of the field records mostly have ´.
  We have left McDavid's territory as he transcribed it in the list manuscripts.  Perhaps we should go through and change all the ´ ° that remain from pre-1964 SAS interviews to r°???  Since this change was not made across word boundaries in other files, it doesn't seem right to do it here, but in many cases it has already been changed.  It is impossible to tell from the spacing of words in the field records if they are to be run together, hence the use of ligature to denote this.  Although there are no ligatures where the change from ´ to r has been made, in the computer files we deleted the space between words, since the change was to be made intervocalically only.  We concluded that the change denoted an erosion of word boundaries.

Summary:  Lowman's territory includes only ´  ° or r  °, although he may have intended a three-way distinction to include r° which was levelled by Kurath.  McDavid's territory includes ´  ° and r°, the latter of which was usually derived by editorial changes from some of the cases of ´  ° and was possibly intended to denote the same phenomenon Lowman used a ligature for (which is no longer marked, following Kurath).  The result of all this is that ´ and r in this file should probably not be taken to represent differing degrees of retroflexion, although the series °, °Ž, ´/r can be used for such an analysis.

	Since this was a question that sought primarily pronunciation information, McDavid recorded any phrase with "year" followed by an unstressed vowel.  Any response that thus provides this opportunity for the occurence of `linking r' where postvocalic /r/ otherwise doesn't occur is an appropriate answer to the question.
	The numerous responses containing "years ago", where /z/ blocks the phonetic phenomenon of interest, are considered inappropriate.  Other responses without "year", although they conceivably might be answers to the worksheet question (e.g. "good while ago"), are also marked INA, as are marginalia.
	Other files including pronunciations of "year" are P4#6, "this year" and G5#1, "three years old".  Linking /r/ also occurs in P67#8, "your aunt".
