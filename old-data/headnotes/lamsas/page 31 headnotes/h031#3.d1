	The map presents the word "wharf".  A number of other terms, incidentally recorded, are also given on the map: "dock", ("boat") "landing", "pier" and "pier head" (127).
	Informants who offer more than one term often comment on differences in meaning as between "wharf" and other terms:
	A "dock" is said to be the water or slip adjoining a "wharf" (17.1, 71.2, 75, 78.2, 137.1, 140.1), or the "wharf" together with the slip 911.1, 35.3, 136.1).  "Docks" are said to be larger than "wharves" (N69, 76.2, 88.2), to be found only in larger harbors (85, 146.1, 3), or to be provided with store houses (76.1)
	A "pier" is said to be smaller than a "wharf" (135.1) or be the end of the wharf (128.1); cf. 127 "pier head".
	A "landing" is a simple platform on a beach, an inlet or a river.
