L:  The wind has been very gentle and it is gradually getting stronger;  you'd say it's doing what?


	The map shows expressions recorded in the sentence ""The" "wind" "is" "rising"¢, or in a similar context, referring to an increase in the strength of the wind: "rising", "raising", "increasing", "breezing", û "up", "springing" "up", "blowing" "harder", "getting" "up", û "higher", etc.
	Expressions consisting of participle plus adjective or adverb regularly have the main stress on the second word.  "Increasing" is stressed on the second syllable, except as indicated on the map.

lms notes:
	Should "blowing" be written always with a hyphen, never with a hyphen, or sometimes with, sometimes without, as in field record?  [followed editorial procedure in "Handbook", under Diphthongs, to use vertical bar if first vowel is not a diphthong]
	"Arising" always written as one word.  There are numerous other verbs with "a-" prefixing.  Should we write "a-rising"? [no]


	There are only a few inappropriate responses in this file.  All come from commentary that is transcribed.  McDavid often recorded responses that are not present participles, but these are not considered inappropriate if they are semantically related to the question.  The file contains numerous instances of "a-" prefixing with present participles, variation between "raising" and "rising" (among others), and 400 instances of "rising" with the /aI/ phoneme.  Antonyms may be found in L7#3, (wind is) "going down".
