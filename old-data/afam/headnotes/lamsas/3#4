	The word "sunset" ("sundown") was regularly recorded as an expression of time in the sentence "We" "work" "until" "sunset". 	Except for a few cases of contrast stress on the second syllable of "sunset" ("sundown"), stress is on the initial syllable.

	Several items are included in this file which are likely appropriate answers to the question (phrased as the time work ended in the evening), but which are not synonymous with "sunset".  These include "after dark", "first dark, dusk, knocking off time", etc., and are not considered INA, as are phrases encompassing the whole day:  "from sun to sun, can-see to can't", etc.  Commentary notes some informants who use both "sundown" and "sunset", but who consider the latter a spectacle rather than a time of day (not marked inappropriate, however).  This file is complementary to L3#2, "sunrise".
