®TS5¯	"Marsh", "marsh(y)" "land", and "salt" "marsh" were the most commonly recorded terms for open, grassy land covered with water.  An inventory of terms in the list follows.
	Lowman elicited these terms by asking where salt hay was grown, along the sea; McDavid, by asking the name for grasslands along the seashore.  Along the seashore, a number of informants gave the response "salt" "marsh" or described "marsh" as sl salt or as fresh or salt; along the shore in New York and New Jersey, informants gave the response "meadow" or "salt" "meadow" for "marsh".
	Further inland the meaning of "marsh" is more variable and more compounds were recorded.  There a "marsh" may lie along a body of fresh water, and the distinction between "marsh" and "swamp" is not always clear cf. List 36 ("Swamp").  In the uplands "marsh" was often unknown.
	The symbol ®MDSU¯2" designates examples of "marsh", "marsh(y)" "land", or "marsh" "place(s)" which have been supplied from other lists; in most instances no other examples of "marsh" was recorded.  Supplied from List 34: PA 4a; from List 35:      ; List 34 ("Lowland"); PA 4a, SC 18a; from List 35 ("Meadow"): VA 51a, FL 3a; List 36 ("Swamp"):   ; List 36b ("Bog"): VA 40a, GA 24a, SC 41b.
