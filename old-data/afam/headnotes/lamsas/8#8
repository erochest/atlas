	The phrases listed here were recorded in the sentence "The wood burns to white ashes".  The usual phrase is "white ashes", but "a white ash" is not uncommon.  On the other hand, "a white ashes" is rare.

	Note that McDavid often did not get the phrase "white ashes".  He got the two words separately.  Lowman usually got the phrase.

	Any phrase that contains either a pronunciation of "white" or of "ash" fits the target of the question.  The diphthong in "white" may be compared with those in "nine" (P1#5a), "twice" (P1a#6), "like" (L88#6), "died" (L78#5), "wife" (L63#2), and "miles" (G88#1), which all have special files with codes for the position and length of the vowels.  Other files with /hw/ are "wheelbarrow" (P23#3), "whip" (p19#4), and "What time is it?" (L4#2).  "Ask" is in P104#1.
	Several informants commented on the type of wood they typically burned.  These are coded as inappropriate along with other commentary and foreign language responses, of which there are two Pennsylvania German and one Dutch term.
	As is our general policy, articles ("a, the") have been omitted unless they are of unusual interest, e.g. with [d] for [ä].  We considered including them here in light of Kurath's comments above, but it could not be confirmed that the field workers had consistently recorded them where they occurred.  It would be incorrect to interpret singular "white ash" as involving syntactic deletion because there is no article when it is just as likely that the article was present but not transcribed.  For this reason, we did not include any Standard English uses of the article.
	Additional pronunciations of "ash" may be found in L19#2, a list of miscellaneous containers including "ash hopper", etc. and in file L44#7 for various types of cornbread including one cooked in the ashes, i.e. an "ash cake".  Other instances of "white" are in L7#4, `frost', in the phrase "white frost".
