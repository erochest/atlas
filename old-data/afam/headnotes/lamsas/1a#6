	Twice was usually recorded, especially by GSL, in the context "twice as good".  McDavid often got analogous phrases such as "twice as much", in which an excrescent [-t] might also appear.  All field workers sometimes recorded twice in other contexts.

	No inappropriate responses are recorded.  Although responses lacking an instance of "twice" (like "double" and "two times as much") were listed in a separate commentary list, they have been included here in the main file as appropriate answers to the question.
	This item is on page 1 of the PSAS worksheets, but some informants have had the page cut in half and glued into a page 1A in the field records.
	This file was used in an analysis of the diphthong /a±/.  Computer files created for that study, which encode the vowel characteristics numerically, are available.
