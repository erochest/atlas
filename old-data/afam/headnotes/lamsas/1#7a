M:  Count from one to twenty slowly.


	Although this list comes from page 1 in the worksheet, the field workers generally asked for the item near the end of the interview.  It was usually Lowman's practice to elicit numbers by asking the informants to count slowly.  McDavid, on the other hand, recorded a great many of the numerals during the interview and from general conversation with the result that his records have numerous "cv" forms and often several variant pronunciations from the same informant.
	The "Atlas" includes a number of lists in which numerals were an integral part of the responses, such as weight, weights and measure, time, go, distance and so forth.  Except when there was no response for the lists of this section those numerals have not been used here but have been retained where elicited.  #55 ("nine" "feet" "high") [number left out], #156 ("bushel") [ditto], #595 ("two" "pounds") [ditto], #301 ("head" "of" "lettuce" [ditto], #302 ("head" "of" "children") [sometimes], #108 (("three") "years" "old") [included], #224 ("yoke" "of" "oxen") [not included], #54 ("miles") [not included], #105 ("half" "past" "seven") [included], #106 ("quarter" "of" "eleven") [included].
