	The map shows only the phrases "half" "past" "seven" and "half" "after" û.  Equivalent and related expression are given in the commentary.
	The main stress is regularly on "seven".  Pronunciations with the main stress on "past" 964.1, 69.2, 78.4, 92.2, 112.1, 146.1, 158.2, 194.1) or  on "after" (116.1, 118.1, 130.1) may be due to artificial emphasis or contrast.

-Kurath

	A number of informants offered "seven" "thirty" as the first or only response, these are entered in the commentary.  Some field workers record the phrase with other numerals than "seven".

Notes:  1) Add prons. of "half" at "jag/turn of wood" (19.8).  [apparently not done]  2) Transfer "seven-thirty" to commentary.  [not done, probably suggested to minimize diffs. betw. fieldworkers, i.e. Lowman didn't record it]

Lists of commentary


	Miscellaneous time phrases were recorded incidentally to this question and L4#5, "quarter to eleven".  Those for times between the hour and half-hour were typically included in this file, those for times after the half-hour, with the other file, L4#5.  Such times, however, were considered inappropriate responses.  Also marked INA are miscellaneous commentary and other pronunciations of "half".
	As noted above, "seven" as the hour is not constant, but the most frequent.  Further pronunciations are found in P1#4A, P1#8B, and P1a#2A:  "seven, twenty-seven", and "seventy", respectively.  Comparable pronunciations of "eleven" are in files P1#6A and L4#5.
