®TS5¯	The map shows the terms for a rough wall of loose stone such as one finds between fields or farms in certain parts of the country: "rock" "fence", "stone" "fence", "rock" "wall", "stone" "wall".
	"Fence" has been replaced by the omission sign (û).  For the pronunciation of the word consult the "rail" "fence" map.
	In the coastal area and in the Piedmont stone walls are uncommon and many informants living there lack a set term.
	The compounds usually have level stress.  Instances with a heavier stress on the first or second member are so marked on the map.
