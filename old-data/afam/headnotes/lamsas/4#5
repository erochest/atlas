	The map shows the phrases "quarter of eleven", "quarter to eleven", "quarter till eleven", and "quarter before eleven".  Equivalent expressions are given in the commentary.
	The main stress is usually on the numeral.
-Kurath


	Some field workers sometimes recorded with other hours than eleven. 
	[Note:  the middle word, "of, to, till, before", must always have a space before and after it]

-McDavid


	Note:  NY467, 474a, 474c "quarter" ° ål²bm.  The /°/ equals "of".  It isn't the first vowel of "eleven".  Checked with list ms (70) for "eleven" (P1#6A).  [However, NY49C and GA29B "quarter eleven" is SIC - EJ]

List of commentary.
List of -"forty-five" compounds.


	Miscellaneous time phrases were recorded incidentally to this question and L4#4, "half past seven".  Those for times between the hour and half-hour were typically included in the other file, L4#4, those for times after the half-hour, with this file.  Such times, however, were considered inappropriate responses.  Also marked INA are miscellaneous commentary.
	As noted above, "eleven" as the hour is not constant, but the most frequent.  Further pronunciations are found in P1#6A,   Comparable pronunciations of "seven" are in files P1#4A, P1#8B, and P1a#2A:  "seven, twenty-seven", and "seventy", respectively, and L4#4.
	Spacing of words was an issue in this file.  The policy of following orthography was followed, as usual, except when a ligature occurred to link them, as in a number of Lowman's New York records.  This was potentially relevant to another editorial consideration, that of [´°] changed to [°r°] in McDavid's pre-1964 SAS records.  It turned out not to be an issue, since the change apparently doesn't apply across word boundaries and McDavid didn't indicate linking of the words "quarter of" anywhere, as Lowman did.  The segments HAD been changed in some places in the list ms., but not in others, so I decided to follow the word boundary rule and leave [´$°] as so often occurs in the MAS.
	The combining of words with ligature in f.r. is contrary to McDavid's editorial policy, but necessary here because of our special use of the ligature for co-articulation.
