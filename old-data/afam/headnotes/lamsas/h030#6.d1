	"River" is the term given by informants for the largest and/or longest stream of running water.  There are cases, due to historical accident, where a name with the generic "creek" refers to a stream larger than some local rivers.  These can usually be identified only from a map.  In tidewater areas some informants note that a river is salt others that is fresh or salt, and some that it is tidal.  See also headnote to List 46 ("Creek").
