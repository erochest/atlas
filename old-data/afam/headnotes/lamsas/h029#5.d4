	The terms in the list are a miscellany denoting a variety of low, wet, or poorly drained places, often of relatively limited extent.  They were usually recorded in conjunction with List 36 ("Swamp"), but also with List 34 ("Lowland"), List 35 ("Meadow") and List 37 ("Marsh").  Their distribution is related to both topography and field worker practice; they are most common in low-lying areas and in records by McDavid.  An inventory of terms in the list follows.
	"Bog" and its compounds are the most widely distributed and the most variable in meaning.  "Mire" denotes a low place in a field, as does "Bog" in the coastal plain of South Carolina and Georgia; see also "bottom®MDSU¯2" in List 34 and "swale" in List 35a.  "Vlei", recorded mainly in the Hudson and Mohawk Valleys, denotes a swamp-like place.
