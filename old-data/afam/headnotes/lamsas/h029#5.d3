File Name:  H029#5.D3

	The proper names in this list were sometimes recorded incidentally to the elicitation of "swamp", but more often in the systematic recording of the names of local streams.  Thus their distribution corresponds generally to that of "swamp®MDSU¯2" `flowing stream of water'.
	Where "bay", "marsh", and "pond"  have the sense `swamp' and occur as proper names they are entered here, similar examples of "branch" and "run" are entered in List 47 ("Branch", "Run").
