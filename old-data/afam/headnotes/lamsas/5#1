	The map shows the phrase "three" "year(s) old".  The phrase "three" "year(s)", without "old", is presumably complete, as spoken in the sentence ""He" "is" "three" "years"¢.
	The main stress in the sentence ""He" "is" "three" "years" "old"¢ is on the last word; "years" is often very weakly stressed.

-Kurath


	Multiple responses in RIM records create a problem.  Suggest:  (VERY tentatively)
	Inflected forms:  1) "Three years old" (if possible) OR (short ?) "years old".  2)variant pronunciations of "years" and "old".
	Uninflected forms:  include numberal with all pronunciation variants UNLESS no inflected forms of "year" occur.

-McDavid


	Two main problems occur with this file.  First, the distinction between variant phrases for describing age, as noted by Kurath above, is lost in McDavid's fieldwork.  The semantic connection between items breaks down, since "three years" no longer necessarily has anything to do with age.  The context "He is...", which may be assumed in Lowman's records, doesn't hold for McDavid.
	The second problem is that some instances of "year" were recorded by RIM without a numerical context.  While we might suppose that all the instances of "year" that RIM recorded with this question are plural, it is conceivable that he may have noted these simply as variant pronunciations, thus invalidating the grammatical basis for analysis.  To solve this potential problem, which rarely occurred, we included such cases with question 2, "a year ago".  Some instances of "a year old", etc. had been moved to that list manuscript, but we moved them back, since they clearly were recorded in the worksheet context of age.  Likewise, responses such as "three years ago" were put back into question 2, since they were given in answer to that question.  We did keep stray pronunciations of inflected "years" with question 1, regardless of where they were found on the page.  These problems are often compounded by the existence of responses on the top, bottom, and side margins of the page, but I think the solution we finally arrived at is satisfactory.
	Two questions from the preliminary SAS worksheet (also often included in the taped interviews) are appended to this file as inappropriate responses.  These are terms meaning `over eighty' and `going on ten'.  Other than these responses, and marginal commentary, any item that provided the informant the opportunity to produce plural "years" with or without inflection (usually with a numeral to carry plural marking) is included, whether it has anything to do with expressing age or not.
	Further pronunciations of "three" are found in P1#2A, of "year" in P5#2, "year ago", and P4#6, "this year".  Other items that are grammatically similar are G7#7, (nine)" feet high", G88#1, (ten) "miles", and G45#5, (two) "pounds".
