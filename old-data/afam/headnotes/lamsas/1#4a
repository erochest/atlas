	Although this list comes from page 1 in the worksheet, the field workers generally asked for the item near the end of the interview.  It was usually Lowman's practice to elicit numbers by asking the informants to count slowly.  McDavid, on the other hand, recorded a great many of the numerals during the interview and from general conversation with the result that his records have numerous "cv" forms and often several variant pronunciations from the same informant.
	The "Atlas" includes a number of lists in which numerals were an integral part of the responses, such as weight, weights and measure, time, go, distance and so forth.  Except when there was no response for the lists of this section those numerals have not been used here but have been retained where elicited.  #55 ("nine" "feet" "high") [number left out], #156 ("bushel") [ditto], #595 ("two" "pounds") [ditto], #301 ("head" "of" "lettuce" [ditto], #302 ("head" "of" "children") [sometimes], #108 (("three") "years" "old") [included], #224 ("yoke" "of" "oxen") [not included], #54 ("miles") [not included], #105 ("half" "past" "seven") [included], #106 ("quarter" "of" "eleven") [included].

-McDavid

In pronunciations of the types of [s²vn, s²ví, sebm], the nasal is syllabic.

-Kurath

The syllabic nasals are not marked as such, following established practice, which omits the syllabic symbol where syllabicity is obvious.  "Seventh" is marked as inappropriate, since it was not the answer to the question and was typically in the margin.  It was possibly recorded incidentally to "fifth" and "sixth"  on page 1A.  There is also an inappropriate Dutch response.

Key files for comparison are P1a#2A, "seventy", P1#8B, "twenty-seven", and G4#4, "half past seven".  "Eleven", P1#6A, and "quarter to eleven", G4#5, may also be of interest.  For other scattered examples of "seven", see G55a#7, "head of lettuce, children" and field records for G7#7, "feet high", and G45#5, "pounds".
