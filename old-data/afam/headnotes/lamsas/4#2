M:  If you want to know the time of day, you ask somebody ____?


	Some informants habitually say "What" "time" "of" "day" is it?.  Others use "What" "o'clock" "is" "it"? besides the usual "What" "time" "is" "it"?
	In "What" "time" "is" "it"? the word "time" has the main stress, "what" and "is" have a weaker stress, "it" is unstressed.
	In "What" "time" "of" "day" "is" "it"? the main stress is usually on "day", occasionally on "time".

list of misc. commentary

	This file is problematic, in that McDavid seems to have recorded any portion of the target question uttered by the informant, including things like "give me" and "what time".  These have been marked as inappropriate responses.  Less straightforward are phrases like "what time it is", some of which are listed in the field record as any other response to the question, in which case they are not marked INA.  Other such phrases contain context in the f.r. which indicate they are subordinate clauses (e.g. "I'd ask him...") or are marked as CNV, suggesting that they were probably taken out of such a context.  These are considered inappropriate.  Each item that was not a likely way of actually asking the time was checked against the field record for such clues.  Those that are marked INA are distinguished also by the absence of a question mark in the orthography and some other gramflag than `S'.
	Aside from the lexical variation, this file is of interest for pronunciations of "what" and "time", and for the syntactic constructions "What time have you?, What time you got?, What time be it?" and the above-mentioned "What time it is?"  This is one of only a few files in LAMSAS that offers comparisons of sentence formation.  P23#3, "wheelbarrow", L23#4, "whetstone", and P19#4, "whip" provide further evidence of [wh-/w-].
