M:  A wind halfway between east and north is ____.



	The map shows the term "northwest".  The main stress is regularly on the second member of the compound.  Wherever the field worker indicated the onset of stress, the stress mark is retained.
	Instead of the adjective or adverb "northeast", several informants offered the noun "northeaster", denoting a wind from the NW.  These terms are entered on the map without comment (thus 16.3, 33.1 35.1, etc).

	This file is closely to related to P6#4, P6#5A and B, and P6#6A, "from the south, southwest wind, southeast wind", and "northwest".  Words for"" miscellaneous compass points were recorded incidentally to these questions, especially by McDavid, though they were not part of the questionnaire.  If they indicate direction of movement, they were included with P6#4, "from the south".  If not, "west" was included in P6#5A, "east" with P6#5B, "north" with P6#6A (systematically investigated with that question in VA and NC), and "south" with P6#4.
	Pronunciations of "northeast" with and without /ù/ cannot be distinguished from the orthography, since we don't typically use spellings with apostrophes to denote omissions.
