	This list includes all responses to 30.1 other than forms of "draining".  Similar responses from 30.2 which seemed to be verb forms were also included.  Nearly all these responses were obtained by McDavid.  "Ditch" "it" was the most common response, and combinations with "ditch" and "ditching" predominate.  See the inventory below for a full list of terms.
