	"Bucket" is in general used to denote a container for water or milk, with flaring sides and a bail, whether it be made of wood or of metal.
	"Pail", on the other hand, has restricted currency and is applied almost exclusively to a wooden container for milk (or water), with straight or flaring sides and one long stave serving as a handle.  The following informants give this description of a "pail": 62.1, 65.1, 78.2, 99.1, 108, 114.1, 130.1, 133.1, 134.1, 138.2, 140.1, 2, N140, 144.1, N150, 154.1, 157.1, 159.1, 161.1, 162.1, N163, N165, 167.1, 169.1, 179.1, 181.1, 189.1, 192.2, 195.1, 197.1, 200.2.  Many regard both the word and the thing as old-fashioned.
	"Noggin" (76.1, 89.1, 95) and "piggin" (63.1, 83.1, 96.1, 115.1, 116.2, 120.2, 123.2, 130.1, 156.1, 160.1, 171, 190.2, 194.2, 197.1, 200.1) are synonymous with "pail".
	Comments of individual informants are reproduced below.  Note especially certain deviating definitions of "pail".
