No lms note, just short list of commentary.



	Anything that would be a likely answer to the questions above, or any phrase that contains a pronunciation of "fog", is considered appropriate.  INA responses were noted marginally or as commentary for another response.
	Compare to P6#8, "fog", P33#1, "dog", and L8#5, "backlog".  Also, there are numerous instances of "bog" in L29#5, "swamp".  "Frog" questions are L60#2 and L60#3.
	Additional cases of "lowery", "dreary", etc. are given in L5#5, "clouding up".  This was a question on the preliminary SAS worksheet, which may account for its being recorded here, though the instances of it in this file are given in the main body of the field record, so that they were listed like any other response to the question.
