	The map shows terms for a brief but heavy rainfall.  Among the most common terms are the compounds "downpour", "pourdown", "gully washer", "cloudburst"; the simplex "flood"; and the phrases "heavy rain"""", "hard" û, "big" û, "pourdown" û, "pouring down" û, "heavy" "shower", "hard" û.
	A "cloudburst" is sometimes described as more severe than a rainfall otherwise designated.  Instances of "cloudburst" so defined are noted in the commentary.
	All compounds have initial stress, with a secondary stress on the second member.  Phrases of the type of "heavy" "rain" have a secondary stress on the adjective and a primary stress on the noun.  The word "deluge" has initial stress, with a secondary stress setting in immediately after the [l].  In some longer expressions, all stress marks written by the field worker are retained.

Move "shower" to following list when defined as lighter.  [anonymous lms note]


	The only responses marked inappropriate are miscellaneous commentary in phonetics.  "Squall" was the most problematic, since it had often been included in the list for L6#2, "thunderstorm", even when recorded with 6.1.  The "thunderstorm" file overlaps with this one, semantically and on the field record page.  Names for storms where wind is the dominant feature (rather than rain or lightning) could logically go with either, but they have routinely been included with "thunderstorm".  Thus, "squall" often went into L6#2, though we have tried to keep in L6#1 the instances of it that were recorded as though synonymous with "heavy rain".  Likewise, words for "hurricane, tornado, blizzard" and other miscellaneous storms that really go with neither file (and are usually found in the margins) are in L6#2.
	Other than L6#2, related files are L6#7, "shower", and L5#5, "clouding up".
