L:  Part of the day before supper?
M:  What do you call the part of the day after you stop saying `Good Morning!'?  How long does afternoon last?


	When both "afternoon" and "evening" appear, these terms refer to the same time of day, though they may differ in social status, in currency, or in connotation.  Precise delimitations of the periods denoted by the several terms were seldom recorded.  A few informants state explicitly that the "evening" begins at noon. (17.1, 19.1, 46.1, 48.1 , 2, 49, 1, 2)  The dividing line between "afternoon" and "evening", when both refer to the time of day before supper, is put variously at "4" o'clock (26, 28, 29.2, 43), at "5" (40.1, 46.2), and at "6" (40.2, 47.1)
	"Afternoon" is described as the usual term by 38, 149.3; and as rare by 41, 62.1, 65.2, 81.2, 84.2, 88.1, 99.2, 100.1, 101.1, 1111.1,1 113.3, 135.2, 159.1, 2, 161.1, 2, 169.1, 176, 181.2, 188.2, 190.2, 195.2, 198.1.
	"Afternoon" is described as a modern term by 11.1, 18.1, 24.1, 25.1, 51.1, 2, 52.2, 53.1, 56,2, 60.2, 74.1, 90.2, 92.1, 97.2, 98.2, 104.2, 108, 116.2, 119.2, 139.2, 147.2, 198.2.  A number of informants give the approximate length of time during which the term has been in use: "60" years (78.3), "40-50" years (31.1), "30-40" years (25.5, 78.4), "25-3" years (53.2, 82.2, 107.2_, "15-20" years (80, 87, 128.2, 132, 137.2), "10" years or less (138.2, 177.2).
	"Evening" `time before supper' is described as the usual or more natural term by 16.3, 22.2, 24.2, 27.2, 30.2, 55.2, 56.2, 3, 64.1, 75, 78.1, 88.2, 93.1, 2, 97.1, 109.2, 117.1, 123.2, 129.2, 131.2, 137.2, 140.2, 143.2, 146.2, 151.2, 157.2, 162.1, 169.2; and as old-fashioned by 11.2, 12.2, 13.1, 16.1, 17.2, 22.1, 29.1, 35.3, 50, 61.2, 62.3, 68.2, 74.2, 100.2, 3, 103.2, 152.3, 183.2, 193.2.
	"Afternoon" usually has the main stress on the last syllable.  Forms with initial stress are identified on the map by the use of a stress mark.

Note in lms in RIM's hand to check lms [102] for greetings.  (Suggestion to combine the lists follows.)  Also:  "because of verlaps, these items ["afternoon" and "evening"] should be published together.  A very long introduction and commentary should be provided.  [Al - this means you! - Raven]¢.


	In creating the computer file, one of the above suggestions was followed and one was not.  Since "good afternoon" and "good evening" were only elicited by McDavid and formed a short list subsidiary to this one, the contents of that list that were derived from question 2.4 were added to this file.  Worksheet questions 2.4 and 2.6 ("afternoon" and "evening") were not combined, however.
	To remedy the confusion/overlap between them in parts of the list ms., the file was proofread from the field records, where the separation is fairly clear between responses to the two questions, especially since 2.5 ("good day") comes between them.  If a response in the fourth position on the page specifically states that it applies to the time after supper, it was put into L2#6.  Likewise for something at the bottom of the page that refers to the time before supper;  it was moved to L2#4.  This decision was based on the stated referent of the worksheet question.
	The list ms. was not corrected during proofreading from the field records, so the computer files and lms have discrepancies between them.  In particular, entries for "afternoon" and "evening" have been deleted if they were recorded in the context of greetings, hence appearing in the subsidiary list that has now been included together with the main list.  This avoids duplication.
	Other greetings may be found in files P2#3 ("good morning"), P2#5 ("good day", usually a leave-taking rather than a greeting), and L2#6 ("evening").  The "afternoon", "evening", and "good morning" files are of particular interest as complementary items for an analysis of distinctions between times of day.  There is a large amount of commentary in all these files noting times of day that use of the term is appropriate.  Other commentary refers to changes in vocabulary, especially the shift from "evening" to "afternoon" to refer to the time after the midday meal.  As with "good morning", names of meals are often included here.  Only marginal commentary transcribed in phonetics is considered inappropriate as a response to the question.
