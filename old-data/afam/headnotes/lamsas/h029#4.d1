	The terms in the list denote in general low-lying grassland, but their meanings vary with both topography and land use.  The most commonly recorded terms are "meadow" or "meadow land", "savanna" or "savanna land", and "hayfield".  An inventory of terms is given below.
	"Meadow" and "meadow land" are usually mowed for hay and sometimes tilled and seeded; they are often described by the informants as low-lying, but also as either low-lying or high, or as high.  In New York, where the description `low-lying grassland' did not always elicit a response, McDavid asked where hay was grown.  "Savanna" and "Savanna land", recorded in the coastal plain south of the Neuse River, denote flat, open grassland, often poorly drained, and sometimes with scattered trees.  Some informants did not distinguish "meadow" from "lowland"; see the headnote to List 34 ("Lowland") and note also the compounds in List 35 with terms for "Lowland" as constituents.
	Along the seashore in New York and New Jersey "meadow" is sometimes described as denoting salt grassland (NY 1, 2b, 5a; NJ 1ab, 6b, 8ab), or as salt or fresh (NY 2a,c; NJ 2a).  In the same area "meadow" was sometimes recorded only as denoting salt marsh, as was the compound "salt meadow"; both terms are entered in List 37 ("Marsh").
	"Prairie" is entered in the main list only where the field workers indicated it as a local term for low-lying grassland, in south Georgia and in Florida.  Incidental examples are entered in the commentary.
	"Meadow", "savanna land" and "prairie" are sometimes described as synonymous with "pasture" or as used for grazing (NY 3c, 49c, 64"c"; NJ 11c; VA 26c; NC 2a*; SC 4a, 14a, 42"d", 42a; FL 4), or as used for both haying and grazing (NY 45c; SC 39a; cf. NY 60"b"); SC 7b, 11"i"; GA 16c, 30b).  List 141 ("Pasture") contains additional examples of "meadow".
	Terms for a low piece of ground running through a meadow are entered in List 35a ("Swale"); compare List 36b ("Bog").
