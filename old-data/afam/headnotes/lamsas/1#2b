M:  Count from one to twenty slowly.


	Although this list comes from page 1 in the worksheet, the field workers generally asked for the item near the end of the interview.  It was usually Lowman's practice to elicit numbers by asking the informants to count slowly.  McDavid, on the other hand, recorded a great many of the numerals during the interview and from general conversation with the result that his records have numerous "cv" forms and often several variant pronunciations from the same informant.
	The "Atlas" includes a number of lists in which numerals were an integral part of the responses, such as weight, weights and measure, time, go, distance and so forth.  Except when there was no response for the lists of this section those numerals have not been used here but have been retained where elicited.  #55 ("nine" "feet" "high") [number left out], #156 ("bushel") [ditto], #595 ("two" "pounds") [ditto], #301 ("head" "of" "lettuce" [ditto], #302 ("head" "of" "children") [sometimes], #108 (("three") "years" "old") [included], #224 ("yoke" "of" "oxen") [not included], #54 ("miles") [not included], #105 ("half" "past" "seven") [included], #106 ("quarter" "of" "eleven") [included].

-McDavid

A considerable number of informants pronounce "four" as [fo°] or as [foº, fo{¹}].  Field worker identifies [foº, fo{¹}] as `quick' pronunciations in such cases.

-Kurath

A considerable number of  informants pronounce "four" as [fo°] or as [foº, fo{¹}].  Field worker identifies [foº, fo{¹}] as `quick' pronunciations in such cases;  such pronunciations are also recorded in conversation.

-McDavid

Pronunciations of the type [foº] or [fo{¹}] were described as natural for Virginia 5A, 7A, 11A, 45A, and 47, and as quick for Virginia 9A, 12B, 14C, 17A, 17B, 22, 29, 41B, 42B, 43B, 44B, 50A, 51A, 51B, North Carolina 18B, 23C, 44, 50B, and 52B.

-lms note

Several responses are considered inappropriate in this file.  These don't contain a pronunciation of the word "four", ("vier, before, fourth").  Some (non-INA) include a word following "four" that begins with a vowel.  This effects a different pronunciation, usually with the `linking "r"', and these responses are differentiated in the lms (where context was omitted) by following the [r] with a ligature.  These are not comparable to instances of "four" in isolation.

Other related files are P1#7B, "fourteen", and P1a#1B, "forty".
