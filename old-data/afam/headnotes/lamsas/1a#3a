L:  If six men were to walk into the room and you looked up as they started to come in, you say "Which man?  Not the last man, but the _____.¢  The next man would be the _____.


	The worksheets suggested that "first, second" (List 82), "fifth" (List 83), and "sixth" (List 84) be obtained in the context "the ______ man,¢ but it cannot be assumed that all responses were recorded in this context.  Lowman, for example, asked, "If six men were to walk into the room and you looked up as they started to come in you say `Which man?  Not the last man, but the _____.'  The next man would be the _____...¢.  It is thus likely that many of his responses were in phrase-final position.  McDavid obtained many of his responses in conversation, and thus recorded them in a variety of contexts.  Where contexts have been recorded in phonetics, they are included in the main list; where recorded in normal orthography, they have been included in the commentary.
	Pronunciations of the vowel of "first" of the types [¸] or [¦] are found mainly among Type I speakers in the South Atlantic States, particularly in VA and NC.  Pronunciations with deletion of the final stop are found throughout the area, but are concentrated in SC and GA.

	Pronunciations of the type of [f¸st] are natural to some old-fashioned informants and reported as "old¢ by others.

	The /-t/ is offten lost, especially when the following word begins with a consonant.  RIM often recorded contexts.

	INA:  Dutch, "worth" offered in commentary for comparison (WV33A).
	This item is on page 1 of the PSAS worksheets, but some informants have had the page cut in half and glued into a page 1A in the field records.
	Additional instances of "first" may be found in the phrase "first bottoms" in L29#3, "lowland".  Cf G18#7, "burst", and L28#2, "purse".  Also, for consonant cluster reduction, see "Sunday before last", L3#6, and "half past", L4#4.
