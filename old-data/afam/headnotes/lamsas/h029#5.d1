	"Swamp" was given by nearly all informants as the term for land covered with water all or part of the year.  An inventory of terms is given below.  Additional examples of some terms in the list, including "bay", "bog", "pond", "slash", "swamp", and their compounds, can be found in List 34 ("Lowland"), List 34 ("Meadow"), and List 37 ("Marsh"), as well as in the commentary to List 36 and in List 36b ("Bog").
	"Swamp" is often described as overgrown with trees, thickets, or bushes.  For some informants "swamp" and "marsh" overlap in meaning; the distinction, if any, between the terms are entered in the commentary.  Additional comparisons of the terms can be found in the commentary to List 37.
	The symbol {2} designates examples of "swamp" which denote a flowing stream of water as well as the adjacent overgrown wetlands.  Examples of "swamp" and "river" "swamp" which were recorded on page 30 of the work sheets as terms for streams are also entered with the symbol {2}.  Examples of "branch" and "run" with a meaning analogous to "swamp"{2} are entered in List 47 ("branch", "run").  The terms with the symbol {2} were  recorded in the coastal plain from Maryland to Florida.
	"Pocosin", recorded mainly in North Carolina, and "bay", recorded mainly in South Carolina, denote in common a swamp without an outlet.  "Bay", i.e., "Carolina" "bay", is a shallow, elliptical depression found throughout the coastal plain, but most commonly in the Carolina.  Some examples of "pond", mostly in South Carolina and Georgia, were indicated as equivalent in meaning to "swamp".  Examples of "bat" in the ordinary sense of a body of water are entered in List 46a ("Inlet"); analogous examples or "pond" are entered in List 46b ("Lake").
	List 36a ("Swamp" "Names") contains additional examples of "swamp" in proper names, in the same list are entered examples of "bat", "marsh", and "pond" used as the names of swamps.  List 36b ("Bog") contains a miscellany of terms for low, wet places.  List 36c ("Hammock") contains terms for a high or grassy place in a swamp.
