/where guests are entertained/

L:  The place in the house where you have chairs for people to talk who come to call.
M:  What do you call the room used for special occasions?


	The informants were asked to name the room (or rooms) for entertaining company.
	Larger houses often have two (or more) such rooms:  a best room ("parlor") and a second-best room ("sitting room").  Smaller houses have only one such room, usually called the "sitting room" or the "living room".  Humble homes often have only one large room, which serves as a living room and as a bedroom as well ("the room", "the fire room", "the house", "the big-house", etc.).
	The following terms are current:

(1) "parlor" (widely used) and "parlor room" (36.2, 96.1, 110.1, 113.1, 129.1, 147.1, 165.1, 166.1).  The "parlor" is, or was, the best room in the house, reserved for rather formal entertaining.  Many houses did not have a parlor.  Both the thing and the word have been going out of fashion.

(2) "sitting room" (widely used), "settin' room" (widely used), "chamber" (in tidewater Virginia), a living room for the family and for informal visitors, sometimes also used for sleeping.  These terms are yielding ground to "living room".

(3) "living room" (widely used), a more modern type of room, often combining the functions of the old "parlor" and the "sitting room".

(4) "front room", used in senses (1), (2) and (3).

(5) "big-house" (in the Carolinas), "great-house" (in north-central North Carolina, "the house" (154.2, 170.1); "big room" (73, 74.1, 84.2, 114.1, 199.1), "large room" (53.1), "the room" (39, N60, 71.1, 141.1, 159.1, 182, 194.2), "fire room" (115.1, N140, 154.1, 176, 191.1, 194.1), "warm room" (112.1).  These terms denote the central room of a small house.

(6) "drawing room", "music room", "library", special rooms in large houses.

(7) "best room" (24.1), "home room" (48.2), "waiting room" (156.1, for entertaining).

	Terms for rooms located on the second floor are followed by a superior {2}.  [lms only, spelled out in computer file]

	Typically, RIM recorded many ancillary forms with this file, most of which were marginally noted and now are marked with INA.  These include:  "dining room, bedroom", and others.  Terms noted as referring to the entire house, some of which fall into category (5) above, are also marked as INA.
	Spellings reflecting the variant pronunciations "sitting" and "setting" are used, but Kurath's "settin'" is not, following LAMSAS editorial procedures.
	The question "rented a room" from page 10 of the preliminary worksheets is included here for its pronunciation of "room", marked as INA.  Other room names collected in conjunction with page 7A, an outline of the informant's house plan, were not included here systematically.  This page was often left out of the interview.  Occasional responses in the list ms. that are not in the field record may have come from this source.
	Page 9 includes terms for "attic" (#7), and "kitchen" (#8), while "pantry" (#1), "porch" (#7), and "junk room" (#3) are found on page 10.
