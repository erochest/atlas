	The map presents the terms for the shelf over the opening of the fireplace.  The more common terms are:
	"mantel, mantelpiece", general;  also "mantelshelf, mantelboard"
	"shelf, clock shelf", in eastern VA and adjoining parts of NC
	"fireboard", in western VA and NC and on the Cape Fear River
	"frontice", in the northeastern part of NC.

There are a few odd responses in this file that seem not to refer to a mantel, e.g. "banister, bookcase".  However, there is no indication in the field record that they are different, since they are listed in the same part of the page with other mantel words.  Thus, they are not marked INA.  It is possible that McDavid recorded "shelf" regardless of its referent, as well as any place a clock or vase might be set.  Where "shelf" is explicitly noted as being in a closet or other place not over a fireplace, or is marginal in the field record, it is marked INA.
