	The terms in the list denote flat, flow-lying, cultivated land, near a stream and flooded in spring; descriptions and distinctions are entered in the commentary.  The most commonly recorded terms were "bottom(s)", "bottom land(s)", "lowland(s)", or "low land(s)", "flat(s)", and "low ground(s)".  An inventory of terms is given below.
	The symbol "®MDSU¯2"¢ designates a second meaning of "bottom(s)", "bottom land", "bottom place", or "low bottom", `low place in a field.'  Both meanings were given by VA 16b and SC 2a; these are designated by the symbol "®MDSU¯3"¢.  Other terms for `low place in a field' are entered in List 36a ("Bog"); compare also List 35a ("Swale").
	In a number of instances informants did not distinguish between the terms for "lowland" and "meadow" (List 35).  Sometimes the informants gave the response "meadow" twice: NY 7H, NJ 12a, 15b, 21b; PA 5B; DE 2A*; MD N9, 13d, #f, 17b, DC 1a; VA 11b, 17a, N59, 61a; NC 63b.  In other cases the informants indicated the equivalency of two or more terms: WV2; MD 16; VA 19b; 55b; NC 62a, 63ab.  In all these cases the responses have been entered on both lists.  Terms in List 34 sometimes appear in Lists 35-37, sometimes as constituents of compounds; compare the respective inventories of terms.
	The terms "interval(e)", "high land", "hollow", "rice land", and "valley" are entered in the main list where the informants indicated equivalency with "lowland".  Otherwise they are entered in the commentary, except for "valley", given in List 34a, and for "hollow", given with "cove" in List 34b.  The commentary also contains these place names recorded by the field worker.
