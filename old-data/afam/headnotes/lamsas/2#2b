-lms note


[List of commentary done by Kurath;  list of every non-"Saturday" variant and commentary done by McDavid.]


	Descriptions, as opposed to names, for the day, e.g. "payday, Jewish Sabbath", are considered inappropriate (These mostly were found in the margins of the list).  "Sabbath" is not marked inappropriate unless the commentary notes that it refers to `Sunday' rather than `Saturday'.  Most instances of "Sabbath" meaning `Saturday' are still doubtful, since they are noted as heard (us. from 7th Day Adventists or Jews) or as old-fashioned.  In up-country South Carolina, where the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church is headquartered, several informants note that these "ARPs" use the term "Sabbath" for `Sunday' (see lms xerox).
	NY31A gives a response heard from his grandfather, /s·m°ró/ "day", for which the spelling "Sommers Day" is uncertain.
	A number of informants in the South drop the middle syllable, leaving /sádd±¿/.  Some coastal informants have the relic vowel [µ] instead of [á]
