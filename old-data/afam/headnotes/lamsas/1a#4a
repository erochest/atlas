L:  If six men were to walk into the room and you looked up as they started to come in, you say "Which man?  Not the last man, but the _____.¢  The next man would be the _____.


	The worksheets suggested that "first, second" (List 82), "fifth" (List 83), and "sixth" (List 84) be obtained in the context "the ______ man,¢ but it cannot be assumed that all responses were recorded in this context.  Lowman, for example, asked, "If six men were to walk into the room and you looked up as they started to come in you say `Which man?  Not the last man, but the _____.'  The next man would be the _____...¢.  It is thus likely that many of his responses were in phrase-final position.  McDavid obtained many of his responses in conversation, and thus recorded them in a variety of contexts.  Where contexts have been recorded in phonetics, they are included in the main list; where recorded in normal orthography, they have been included in the commentary.

	INA:  Dutch, "twelfth" (from commentary for comparison), plural noun.
	GA4N has "five";  see headnote for "second", P1a#3B.  Other ordinals with final [ù] (often deleted) are found in the corresponding cardinal number files from page 1, note especially P1#6B, "twelve", and in P1a#4B, "sixth".
	This item is on page 1 of the PSAS worksheets, but some informants have had the page cut in half and glued into a page 1A in the field records.
