	Instead of [w], several informants have a [â] or a [ö] sound:  88.1, 2, 127, 136.2.
	The field worker regards the [¸]-like sound as a member of the [µ] phoneme in the following instances: 67.3, 88.2, 123.2.

	Parts of the verb "to watch", where they can be identified, are inappropriate answers to the question.  Only one such response is uninflected.  Adjectives to describe watches, usually marginal in the field record, are also marked INA.  Note the nickname "turnip":  large pocket watches are sometimes called onions in Polish.  P18#1, "wash", could make an interesting comparison.
