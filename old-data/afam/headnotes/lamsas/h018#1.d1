	The phrase was recorded in the sentence: "I must wash the dishes".
	In several cases only "wash" was taken down, in several others only the ³d/sg. "washes". 
	Some informants sat "wash" "up" "the" "dishes":  N53, N60, 61.1, N69, 71.1, N91, 93.1, N140, N165.
	The article is often  weakly articulated.  Pronunciation of the types of [d°, d±¿] and [t°, t±¿] (after a voiceless consonant) are not uncommon among the simple folk, both White and Negro.
