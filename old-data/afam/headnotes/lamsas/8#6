M:  What would you call the kind of wood you use to start a fire?  How about something you'd get when you cut down a pine tree, rich wood you could light directly from a match?


®FC¯Kindling

	The map presents the terms for the sticks of wood, usually pine, with which the fire is started in the fireplace or the stove.
	The following terms are in use:
®IP5,5¯
(1) "lightwood", "lighterd", in the piedmont and on the coast as far north as southern Maryland.  Note the pronunciation [l²d°d] (93.1, 166.1) and [láñ´d] (19.1), and the expressions "lighter wood" (N35, 61.2), "lightning wood" (35.3, 132).  The stress is on "light"-.

(2) "pine", "black pine", "dry pine", "fat pine", "heart pine", "kindling pine", "light pine", "pitch pine", "rich pine", "rosin pine", "yellow pine".  In all compound expressions the stress is on the second member, except as noted on the map.  These expressions are current on Delaware Bay and in the Blue Ridge.

(3) "kindling", "kindlings" (24.1), "kindling wood", "pine kindling" (53.1), current in most of Maryland, in Delaware and in New Jersey.

(4) "rosin wood" (25.3, 32.2), "fat wood" (11.1).

(5) "pine torch" (106).

	This item was added after the preliminary survey;  hence the gaps.  [Additional commentary.]

	As noted above, this question was not asked throughout the survey area.  Only the South Atlantic States were systematically queried.  In particular, there are only a few responses noted in New York.  New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia are incomplete and this item was not part of the Preliminary South Atlantic worksheets.
	We have chosen to represent the spellings "lightwood" and "lighterd" separately, to indicate pronunciations with and without the /w/.  Presence or absence of /-r/ is not diagnostic here since many areas are r-less.  Both spellings are found in LAGS, though not in the unabridged dictionaries.  Speakers using the "lighterd" variant usually do not consider it a reduced form of the unfamiliar "lightwood".  This would make an interesting etymological investigation.
	Several informants mention turpentining practices.  See DARE for entries on "cat face" and "heart pine".  Not all responses refer to a type of pine.  In the Appalachians, especially, the type of pine typically used as lightwood does not grow and other woods are used for kindling, though the term "rich pine" is known.  One informant for Johnson 1992 gave the following folk etymology for "lightwood":  before electricity was common, if someone wanted to read or do some sewing without lighting the lamp, they could throw a piece of it on the fire and it would blaze up and make a light.
