File name: H029#3.D3

	"Valley" was recorded incidentally to "lowland" or "mountain" (List 42).  Note that there are three examples of "valley" on the main "Lowland" list (NY 34d; SC 28d; GA 16c).  Three place names (NY 45c, 53a, 62b) are included in the commentary.  See the inventory on p. 340 for the normal spelling of these names.
