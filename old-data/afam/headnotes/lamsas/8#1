	Appropriate answers for this pronunciation file are any phrase with the word "chimney" or any synonym for `chimney'.  Synonyms are limited to words for an outlet for smoke from a fireplace in a residence.  A few terms referring to a stove pipe are marked as inappropriate.  Also marked as INA are words for industrial smokestacks.  There are quite a few of these, since this subsidiary question was systematically asked for the preliminary worksheets.  Instances of "smokestack", "flue", etc. that are not marginal in the field records or noted as having special uses (i.e. industrial, on engines, trains, or ships, or for a stove) are left as appropriate responses.
	As can be seen from the tally, this file contains some interesting commentary on chimney construction in addition to the phonetic variation.  Variant pronunciations, such as the one with /bl/ for /n/, are not reflected in the spelling.
