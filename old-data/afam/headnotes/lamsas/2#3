	The salutation "good morning"! is used in meeting.  The stress is on the second word.
-Kurath

	The salutation "good morning" is used almost exclusively in greeting.  Exceptions are noted below.  The primary stress fo the phrase is normally on the initial syllable of "morning".  [No list follows of "exceptions¢].

-McDavid

	RIM occasionally recorded "morning" in conversation.  [Result:  that for these instances of the word we have no way of knowing if it is a greeting or if it was recorded simply as a variant pronunciation of "morning". EJ]  [A list of commentary follows, mostly on restrictions on time of day appropriate for "good morning".]

-McDavid

	"Forenoon" as a synonym for "morning" was incidentally recorded from a number of informants.  [List follows.]

-McDavid

	Note:  Some of Lowman's informants---especially in PA German area---are recorded with [±] rather than [±¿] in the unstressed syllable of "morning".  Check carefully.

-McDavid


	This item was originally intended to record variant greetings, according to the worksheet question.  McDavid's recording of any conversational "morning" raises doubts about the status of the word alone as an elided form of the greeting "good morning".  Certainly, instances that were recorded preceded by an article or demonstrative are not greetings, and "the" is included in this file (although normally deleted elsewhere as per standard editorial practice) in order to disambiguate at least these occurences of "morning" as non-greetings.
	As a consequence of this choice by RIM, we considered any response that contained a pronunciation of "morning" to be an appropriate answer to the question, even those that clearly are not greetings.  Synonyms of "morning", i.e. "forenoon", are also appropriate, as are phrases which might occur as greetings before noon but do not contain the word "morning".
	This leaves essentially phonetic transcriptions from the marginal commentary as the only inappropriate responses.  There are numerous comments of ethnographic interest as to restrictions on the use of the greeting.  Also, several comments refer to the term "dinner" meaning `midday meal'.  There are probably other instances of names for meals in the margins of the field records that were never added to a file.  If there was a comment "greeting only¢, this has been omitted, since this is the assumed unmarked use of "good morning".
	Other greetings may be found in files L2#4 ("afternoon"), P2#5 ("good day", usually a leave-taking rather than a greeting), and L2#6 ("evening").  The "afternoon" and "evening" files are of particular interest as complementary items for an analysis of distinctions between times of day.  The "good day" file offers numerous additional pronunciations of "good".
