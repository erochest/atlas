M:  A wind halfway between south and east you call a ____.


	The map shows the terms "southeast" "wind" and "southeaster".  The word "wind", in the phrase "southeast" "wind", was sometimes omitted from the record.
	Stress was only rarely marked.  All stress marks written by the field worker in the expression "southeaster" (but not in "southeast" "wind") are retained on the map.

	This file is closely to related to P6#4, P6#5A, and P6#6A and B, "from the south, southwest wind, northwest", and "northeast".  Words for"" miscellaneous compass points were recorded incidentally to these questions, especially by McDavid, though they were not part of the questionnaire.  If they indicate direction of movement, they were included with P6#4, "from the south".  If not, "west" was included in P6#5A, "east" here with P6#5B, "north" with P6#6A (systematically investigated with that question in some areas), and "south" with P6#4.
	"East" and related words are marked inappropriate in this file, as are other marginalia.  An interesting bit of folklore lies in the description of east winds as sickly, bad, and poisonous.
	Pronunciations of "southeaster" with and without /ù/ cannot be distinguished from the orthography, since we don't typically use spellings with apostrophes to denote omissions.
