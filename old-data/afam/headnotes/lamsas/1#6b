	Although this list comes from page 1 in the worksheet, the field workers generally asked for the item near the end of the interview.  It was usually Lowman's practice to elicit numbers by asking the informants to count slowly.  McDavid, on the other hand, recorded a great many of the numerals during the interview and from general conversation with the result that his records have numerous "cv" forms and often several variant pronunciations from the same informant.
	The "Atlas" includes a number of lists in which numerals were an integral part of the responses, such as weight, weights and measure, time, go, distance and so forth.  Except when there was no response for the lists of this section those numerals have not been used here but have been retained where elicited.  #55 ("nine" "feet" "high") [number left out], #156 ("bushel") [ditto], #595 ("two" "pounds") [ditto], #301 ("head" "of" "lettuce" [ditto], #302 ("head" "of" "children") [sometimes], #108 (("three") "years" "old") [included], #224 ("yoke" "of" "oxen") [not included], #54 ("miles") [not included], #105 ("half" "past" "seven") [included], #106 ("quarter" "of" "eleven") [included].

Memo to ed. asst. from RIM   re:  transcription problems

Lowman's cursive script creates 2 problems:
	1)  Sometimes there is an upward loop on ² which might be his £ (= atlas À).  In only one case was the £ unequivocal, and that is so entered [there are none in the file now - EJ].  But the vowel should be checked, so that the transcription can be corrected ere typing begins.
	2)  The final consonant is sometimes clearly w, esp. in WV and W. PA.  I have realized this only lately.  All should be checked.  [No responses in WV or PA have final w now - EJ]


INA:  Dutch and the ordinal number.  Note that a following context, esp. the word "feet", often leads to deletion of the final [v].  This contextual information may be in the phonetic entry or may be noted in the comtext

Page 7 and page 5 of the field records may have additional instances of "twelve".  Some files from page 4 also have it, esp. "good morning" and "afternoon".
