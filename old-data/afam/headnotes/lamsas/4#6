M:  Business wasn't very good last year, but I hope it will be better ____.


	This phrase was usually recorded with a heavy stress on the first word, i.e. as Â"this" "year", contrasting with  Â"last" "year".
	The word "year" is variously pronounced: j±¥, j±∞, j≤¥, j≤∞, j¥, j≥, and j¿.

-Kurath

	Field workers occasionally recorded "last" "year", "next" "year".  These are given in the commentary [no, included in main list].

-McDavid


	Any response that was a plausible response to the question above, or that contained a pronunciation of "this year", was considered appropriate, leaving only "last year" and "year" as INA.
	Further instances of" year" are found in "three years old", P5#1, and "year ago", P5#2.  One file with comparable sandhi assimilation is G12#6, "aren't/ain't you".
