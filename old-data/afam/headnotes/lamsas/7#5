	This file gives the simple past of the verb `to freeze'.  Instances of "freeze" are sometimes marked as infinitives.  Unless they are so marked or are found in the margin of the field record they are considered to be past tense forms.  "Frozen" is usually marked as a past participle (often by context given in the commentary) or is denoted as such by following a semi-colon in the list manuscript.  Also, the past participle was specifically elicited in the preliminary SAS worksheets.  Past participles and infinitives are not counted as appropriate answers to the question.
	Noun phrases such as "a skim of ice" are also inappropriate.  Past tenses of equivalent verbs are not inappropriate and some, e.g. "skummed over" are interesting preterits themselves.  Unconventional spellings are employed for this and other ablaut past tense forms, such as "friz", following LAGS.
	Further instances of "freeze" are found in L7#4 ("frost").  Other past tense verbs included in LAMSAS are G3#3, "rose", G6#3, "blew", et al.
