M:  A wind halfway between west and north is ____.


	The map shows the term "northwest".  The main stress is regularly on the second member of the compound.
	Instead of the adjective or adverb "northwest", several informants offered the noun "northwester" ("nor'wester"), denoting a wind from the NW.  These terms are entered on the map without comment (thus 16.3, 33.1 35.1, etc).
	[list of commentary follows]

	The word "northern" was regularly recorded in Virginia and North Carolina, often in the phrase "Northern Neck" (denoting the peninsula between the Potomac and the Rappahannock Rivers).  [list follows]

	This file is closely to related to P6#4, P6#5A and B, and P6#6B, "from the south, southwest wind, southeast wind", and "northeast".  Words for"" miscellaneous compass points were recorded incidentally to these questions, especially by McDavid, though they were not part of the questionnaire.  If they indicate direction of movement, they were included with P6#4, "from the south".  If not, "west" was included in P6#5A, "east" with P6#5B, "north" here with P6#6A (systematically investigated in VA and NC, as noted above), and "south" with P6#4. 	"North" and "northern" are thus not marked inappropriate in this file.
	Pronunciations of "northwest" with and without /ù/ cannot be distinguished from the orthography, since we don't typically use spellings with apostrophes to denote omissions.
