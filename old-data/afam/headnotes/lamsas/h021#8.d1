	"Stone" "boat", for moving stones out of fields, or a substitute for a wagon on hilly or soft ground, was systematically investigated only in the MAS.  Preliminary investigation of the SAS did not reveal it to be productive though a number of names were recorded for a similar conveyance used for a variety of hauling job including specialized agricultural tasks.  A "stone" "boat" is a narrow platform usually made of planks fastened crosswise to timbers curved or pointed to serve as runners, though runners were not always required.  The platform was close to the ground to facilitate the loading of heavy or bulky objects.  A cruder, less versatile version, a "lizard", was made by nailing planks across the fork of a tree.
