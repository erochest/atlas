File Name H029#7.D1

®TS5¯	"Loam" is usually defined as soil containing a mixture of sand, clay, and vegetable matter in varying proportions, but there is a wide range of variation in the descriptions given by the informants (see the commentary for particulars).  In New England, the term usually means `heavy, rich soil', a description included in the PSAS work sheets.  Though subsequently dropped from the SAS survey, a number of examples were recorded in SC by McDavid, and in SC and FL in the later taped interviews using combined work sheets.  "Loam" was restored to the MAS work sheets, but since it was found that "loam" often refereed to poor, sandy soil, the field workers were asked, particularly in NY, to obtain terms both for poor and rich soil.  Note also that Lowman was interested in "loam" primarily as a pronunciation item, whereas McDavid usually asked formants to name local soil types.
