the room is nine)

Speaking of rooms and their height, you say this room is about nine ____.

	The map shows the phrases "feet" "high" and "foot" "high", recorded in the sentence "The room is nine feet high".  Where only the word "feet" or "foot" is entered, the word "high" was lacking in the record, either because the informants did not use it in the given context ("The room is nine feet") or because the field worker, interested primarily in the plural of "foot" did not record the adjective.

	Although Lowman often did not record either element of the context, "nine" or "high", McDavid usually did.  RIM often recorded the plural of "foot" in connection to topics other than the height of the ceiling.  Preceding numerals are not included in the file, due to list manuscript practice, though the following adjective ("high, wide, long", etc.), if recorded, is.
	Occasionally context is recorded to show that the response is a) not plural, or b) adjectival rather than adverbial.  These, e.g. in the phrase "nine-foot ceiling", are considered inappropriate.  The only other inappropriate respones are a few items from commentary and foreign language responses.
	Related files are G88#1, "miles", and G45#5, "pounds".
