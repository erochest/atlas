We have a)  /light or severe?/

L:  If there is a white coating on the ground in the morning, you say you had a ____.

(PSAS "chilly") L:  If you come out on a cold morning in the winter and the air seems to go right through you, you say it is kind of what this morning?

	The map presents (1) the word "frost" and (2) the expressions for a killing frost: "big" "frost", "biting" û (34.2, 53.1, 90.2), "black" û (common), "hard" û, "heavy" û, "jack" û (11.1, 16.2, N63, 76.1, N107) "black" "jack" û (122.2, 167.1, 169.2, 181.2), "killing" û (common), "terrible" û, and "freeze".  A "freeze" is sometimes defined as a severe "killing" "frost".
	All complex expressions have level stress.  "White" "frost" (22.2) and "hoar" "frost" (25.3), denoting a light frost, and "nipping" "spell" (7.2) were each recorded once, but are doubtless common.
	list of commentary follows
-Kurath


	The pronunciation of "dew" was sought by Lowman in his later records from NJ and WV, and systematically in Ohio and New York state.  Occasional examples were recorded by RIM, especially in his transcriptions of the taped interviews by O'Cain, Pederson, Pederson's students and Udell.
	To Proof Readers:  Check extra pages "and" the slips gathered by RIM from marginalia.
	Look for other examples in McD records under 6.7, "drizzle".
-McDavid


	The large (400+) number of inappropriate responses in this file is a result of combining answers to three questions:  "frost, dew", and "chilly".  "Dew" was chiefly elicited by Lowman in some Middle Atlantic States as noted above.  "Chilly" was an item on the preliminary South Atlantic States questionnaire.  Neither of these had enough responses to make a separate file.
	The responses to the main question were divided in the McDavid list manuscripts, but not those done by Kurath, into terms for a normal frost and a heavy frost.  We found no clear justification in the field records for such a division.  Still, most informants gave at least two responses, yielding, with the additions described above, an unusually large file.
	The target response was a noun.  Verbs, descriptive adjectives and other marginalia are considered inappropriate.  File 7#5, "froze", elicits the past tense of the verb used to describe this phenomenon on water rather than the ground and includes additional instances of "freeze" and "freezed".  Other weather words are found on page 6.
