L:  If you like the weather out, you'd say, "It's a ____ day".
M:  You look up at the sky and there are no clouds around and say, "I believe we're going to have a ____."


	The map shows the phrases recorded in the sentence ""It's" "a" "fine" "day", characterizing a day that is clear and agreeable.  The phrases most commonly offered are "pretty" "day", "fine" û, "nice" û, "pleasant" û, "lovely" û, "beautiful" û, "good" û.
	The main stress is regularly on "day".
	To conserve space on the map, the omission sign (û) has been used to repeat the word "day"; but it is to be borne in mind that all the adjectives were spoken with this word following.  In a number of cases "day" was not recorded.  [list of commentary]

-Kurath


	As noted above, there are many cases of adjectives recorded here without the word "day".  We left these as they were in the field records, although sometimes "day" had been added in the list manuscript, usually copied from another response by the same informant.
	The pronunciation of "pretty" is of interest and may be compared to a similar metathesis in L64#3, "children".  Numerous other instances of "day" are found in P2#5, "Good day".  Antonyms, i.e. "gloomy day", were collected with the preliminary SAS worksheets.  These have been appended to L5#5, "clouding up", as inappropriate responses.
